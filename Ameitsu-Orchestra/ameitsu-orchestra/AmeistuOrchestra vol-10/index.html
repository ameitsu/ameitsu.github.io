As people became more aware in global warming around 2004, therefore the film was praised of alerting people the deadly consequence of a global scale climate change. The special effect of the film, especially the panorama of the frozen New York City and the vast tornado clusters that wiped Los Angeles off the map, stunned the eyes of the audiences in the time when such technologies were indeed quite rare. Yet exactly 20 years later, as the global warming continues and global situations gradually altered, we might need to re-watch the film with today’s eyes.</p><h1 id="the-story"><a class="anchor" href="#the-story">#</a> The story</h1><p>To start with, it is apparent that this film is certainly another superhero-like story that emphasized heroism. Anyway, the plot can be divided into the following chapters:</p><h2 id="i-something-is-wrong"><a class="anchor" href="#i-something-is-wrong">#</a> I. Something is wrong!</h2><p>Jack Hall, a paleoclimatologist, completed a model of the prehistoric climate change, and suggested the current rate of global warming might cause a disorder in the global ocean current system like the ancient case, directly leading to a rapid ice age. With snowfall in New Delhi, hailstone in Tokyo and showers in New York, the climate was malfunctioning then.</p><h2 id="ii-tragedies-and-meaningless-waiting"><a class="anchor" href="#ii-tragedies-and-meaningless-waiting">#</a> II. Tragedies and meaningless waiting</h2><p>Within several days, most sectors of Los Angeles were wiped off the map by a cluster of tornados. Upcoming was the sudden plunge in temperature in the North Atlantic Drift. Then rain showered New York for three continuous days. The climate was undoubtedly ill. Everything happened proved Jack’s assumption, yet no one listened to him.</p><h2 id="iii-the-blizzard"><a class="anchor" href="#iii-the-blizzard">#</a> III. The blizzard</h2><p>Three British military helicopters malfunctioned and downed above the highlands of Scotland, as the eye of an extraordinary snow storm hit the British Isles. It was -110°C there. The shower in New York turned into a blizzard. Lower Manhattan was submerged, trapping Jack’s son, Sam. Sam alongside with his friends sought shelter in the New York City Library, and had to burn books to stay warm.</p><h2 id="iv-the-extraction"><a class="anchor" href="#iv-the-extraction">#</a> IV. The extraction</h2><p>Right before the meteorology lab was struck by the blizzard, Jack finished all tasks and determined to save his son. He succeeded though, yet one teammate of him sacrificed himself on the.</p><h2 id="v-aftermath"><a class="anchor" href="#v-aftermath">#</a> V. Aftermath</h2><p>The entire northern hemisphere was buried by snow, therefore US citizens fled to Mexico. After the storm dissolved, the US government-in-exile sent forces to recover the survivors. The earth entered the second Ice Age.</p><h1 id="impressions"><a class="anchor" href="#impressions">#</a> Impressions</h1><h2 id="background"><a class="anchor" href="#background">#</a> Background</h2><p>One of the most stunning aspects – and one of the most boring one - is that the film is based on a 100% truth: global warming. There’s a good reason why this can be both advantage and disadvantage: global warming seemed too far away from daily lives in many people’s perspective, therefore omitting its consequence, and that is what the film all about. A second Ice Age is over sensational however, yet the unexplored and deadly potential of the delicate climate system is well-illustrated.</p><h2 id="mankinds-efforts"><a class="anchor" href="#mankinds-efforts">#</a> Mankind’s efforts</h2><p>In the film 2012, we witnessed how selfish humans were during disasters, yet in The day after tomorrow the noble sides of humans were greatly emphasized. While government officials denied Jack’s proposal to evacuate half of the US, groups of insightful researchers joined Jack and began to analyze the storm; Meteorologists continued their survey on seawater temperatures until they exhausted all supplies; Ambulances were sent even after the blizzard hit northern US. There are always people who care about mankind and it is an unquestionably truth rather than an artistic illustration. After all, we have been through the COVID-19, and we still memorize the ones who risked their lives for the lives of others.</p><h2 id="the-catastrophe"><a class="anchor" href="#the-catastrophe">#</a> The catastrophe</h2><p>The thing that hit earth wasn’t a normal blizzard at all - it is actually a snowing hurricane. The sheer scale of the blizzard definitely evoked audiences’ megaphobia. Furthermore, the eye of the blizzard reached the lowest temperature of -110°C, while currently the most freezing spot on the Earth was just -90°C. This contrast between reality and fiction obviously astonished viewers. Mother nature certainly can turn her back on us, though not as catastrophic as the blizzards in the film, yet we are constantly observing odd weather phenomena like the double el niño. Perhaps a catastrophe would really loom our delicate world one day.</p><h2 id="the-world"><a class="anchor" href="#the-world">#</a> The world</h2><p>In 2012, we have seen how all world landmarks became destroyed, how all the tectonic plates shifted in one day, how the two poles changed direction, in the hands of Roland Emmerich. And in The day after tomorrow we observed how Europe was covered under 4 meters of snow, how New York was submerged under sea ice, how the entire northern hemisphere became white. Americans fled to Mexico, which is an ironic scene compared with reality. Seeing the civilization, the place we live in and beloved ones coming to an end is assuredly more painful than being frozen in the storm.</p><h1 id="real-world-connections"><a class="anchor" href="#real-world-connections">#</a> Real-world connections</h1><h2 id="global-warming"><a class="anchor" href="#global-warming">#</a> Global warming</h2><p>Disaster films’ directors tend to set the background with abnormal events, for instance super volcanoes and asteroid collisions. Nevertheless, this film is based on the phenomena that affected mankind for decades – global warming. Indeed, the climate system is changing. In Beijing alone, we experienced the lowest temperature in 60 years, the highest temperature since 1961 and the largest rainfall in the past 2 centuries in only two years. However, we are seeing changes. As renewable energy, anti-pollution movements and international cooperation roll out, we certainly have a promising future. It is more likely that the global scale blizzard won’t be formed, still, we have to cope with the chaotic weathers.</p><h2 id="inheriting-our-culture"><a class="anchor" href="#inheriting-our-culture">#</a> Inheriting our culture</h2><p>To stay warm, Jack’s son, Sam, reluctantly burned books with friends and remaining librarians. Sam was confused when he saw one of the librarians held the Guttenberg Bible tight with his hands, preventing it from being burnt. The librarian claimed that the book symbolized the new era of western culture as it is the first printed book in Europe and he could actually preserve a piece of the precious history with a tiny effort. That reminds people of the critical function of culture. As long as the culture’s bloodline continues, hope will be there with the people. That is part of the reason how China defeated Japanese invasion, how Simon Bolívar and San Martin liberated South America, how the Allies gained victory from the Axis in WWII……. Culture is an intangible and priceless thing that defined humanity, therefore inheriting it is our utmost mission for our next generation.</p><h2 id="responsibility-of-going-reverse"><a class="anchor" href="#responsibility-of-going-reverse">#</a> Responsibility of going reverse</h2><p>After New York froze, Jack resolutely packed his polar gear to start his expedition to that inaccessible city. Surely, he wanted to save his trapped son, however another reason is that he needs to inspect the status of the northern lands. During that time, the eventual National Disaster Order had been issued, large numbers of US citizens were relocated into the south, even the US government members were transferred to Mexico, there seemed no reason of advancing reversely into the blizzard. Yet the responsibility within propelled Jack and his teammates to start the literally impossible mission. In the reality, during epidemics such as COVID-19 and various major earthquakes, courageous pioneers who risked their lives and rushed into affected zones for search-and-rescue missions are commonly seen. Responsibility of going reverse is not an obligation for everyone, but when it comes to those critical moments, it is the internal bond that keeps humans united.</p><h2 id="flee-or-fight"><a class="anchor" href="#flee-or-fight">#</a> Flee or fight?</h2><p>“Flee or fight” is originally a psychological term, which describes the rapid decision between doing something and keeping safe made by one’s instinct in case of emergency. In the film, hopeless survivors of the New York rain who gathered in the City Library met a dilemma: Though the library provided a shelter for them, the water outside began to freeze under low temperature, forming a viable path to escape the city. Therefore, most of the people started to leave the library. Yet Sam already received the warning from his father, saying that staying indoors is a lot safer. In the end, Sam and other people remaining indoors survived until Sam’s father arrived, while the ones who left earlier were all frozen. When meeting such occasions when you are forced to make tough choices, consider carefully between “flee” and “fight”. Always remember to survive the main trouble first, and in terms of the rest, just let it go.</p><h2 id="mankind-and-earth"><a class="anchor" href="#mankind-and-earth">#</a> Mankind and Earth</h2><p>Humans are among the species in the galaxy that dominated an entire planet. We believed that we could harness and exploit the planet that we stand on, as humans bridged rivers, rerouted waterways, transformed landscapes in millennia of exploration. Nevertheless, we sometimes underestimate the mighty force of mother nature. In the film, the US vice president rejected Jack’s proposal of combating with global warming as he believed that their economy was far more important. Productivity indeed is the internal power that shapes human society, even so, we should not override nature. After all, humans are just over-evolved apes, consuming our habitat is the worst thing we can ever do.</p><h2 id="trusting-someones-competence"><a class="anchor" href="#trusting-someones-competence">#</a> Trusting someone’s competence</h2><p>In the film, the vice president of US didn’t accept Jack’s plan, as he believed knowledge about economy and policies are better in this blizzard; Jack’s boss denied Jack’s access to super computers, as he thought Jack was only a guy who research ancient weather, not present ones; Sam failed a calculus test because he didn’t write any solutions, since the teacher couldn’t do calculus in his mind therefore, he anticipated Sam couldn’t and cheated. When someone claimed to have capabilities in something, just let him or her testify.</p><h1 id="film-related-trivial-stuff"><a class="anchor" href="#film-related-trivial-stuff">#</a> Film- related trivial stuff</h1><h2 id="roland-emmerich"><a class="anchor" href="#roland-emmerich">#</a> Roland Emmerich</h2><p>He is the person who destroys Earth better than anyone. The day after tomorrow, 2012, and Moonfall are several of his disaster films. The day after tomorrow gathered people’s attention on urgent environment issues, and 2012 pictured a doomsday according to the Mayan calendar, and even spelled fear among people! And Moonfall …… that was totally an accident, as audiences are getting bored about seeing earth being rampaged time after time.</p><h2 id="heroism"><a class="anchor" href="#heroism">#</a> Heroism</h2><p>The film portraited one saint – Jack Hall. He seemed to know everything about the blizzard, forecasted long before its arrival, and could traverse ice-sealed Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersy. In a word, these feats just seemed unreal. In modern times, literally nothing can be done solo. Cooperation is the thing matters since we are humans that can assist each other.</p><h2 id="plot"><a class="anchor" href="#plot">#</a> Plot</h2><p>Well, not complicated though. That is another reason of its success – simple to understand, so that viewers’ brains are able to enjoy the sound and visual effects. But the storyline is so typical that it can be applied on literally any similar films: a genius found something odd, then this genius told others but no one listened, and tragedy come, and everyone is saved by the genius. It would be better if there are more twists and jump-scares.</p><h1 id="conclusion"><a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h1><p>Overall, The day after tomorrow is a thrilling film in terms of special effects, depth in content and imagination, even reflected numerous real-life issues. However, lacking ingenuity in plot and the emphasize on heroism are main targets of criticism. It truly outstands among all those disaster films. The end.</p><p><script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="ameitsu/ameitsu.github.io" issue-term="title" label="Comments" theme="github-light" crossorigin="anonymous" async></script></p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/%E5%8E%9F%E5%88%9B/" rel="tag"><i class="ic i-tag"></i> 原创</a> <a href="/tags/%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%AD%E7%89%B2STY/" rel="tag"><i class="ic i-tag"></i> 高中牲STY</a> <a href="/tags/Ameitsu-Orchestra/" rel="tag"><i class="ic i-tag"></i> Ameitsu Orchestra</a> <a href="/tags/%E6%B0%B4%E6%B0%B4%E6%B0%B4/" rel="tag"><i class="ic i-tag"></i> 水水水</a></div></div><footer><div class="meta"><span class="item"><span class="icon"><i class="ic i-calendar-check"></i> </span><span class="text">更新于</span> <time title="修改时间：2024-04-03 21:46:08" itemprop="dateModified" datetime="2024-04-03T21:46:08+08:00">2024-04-03</time></span></div><div id="copyright"><ul><li class="author"><strong>本文作者： </strong>STY <i class="ic i-at"><em>@</em></i>Cyberpark Nichōme</li><li class="link"><strong>本文链接：</strong> <a href="https://ameitsu.github.io/Ameitsu-Orchestra/ameitsu-orchestra/AmeistuOrchestra%20vol-10/" title="Ameitsu Orchestra vol.10 | The day after tomorrow in a certain point of view">https://ameitsu.github.io/Ameitsu-Orchestra/ameitsu-orchestra/AmeistuOrchestra vol-10/</a></li><li class="license"><strong>版权声明： </strong>可以在标注STY很可爱的情况下复制或转载。</li></ul></div></footer></article></div><div class="post-nav"><div class="item left"><a href="/Ameitsu-Orchestra/ameitsu-orchestra/AmeistuOrchestra%20vol-9/" itemprop="url" rel="prev" data-background-image="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdnjson.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;19&#x2F;Ameitsu-Orchestra-Banner.png" title="Ameitsu Orchestra vol.9 | 说预判"><span class="type">上一篇</span> <span class="category"><i class="ic i-flag"></i> Ameitsu Orchestra</span><h3>Ameitsu Orchestra vol.9 | 说预判</h3></a></div><div class="item right"><a href="/at-STY/at-STY/%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E8%8A%82/" itemprop="url" rel="next" data-background-image="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img2.imgtp.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;YfIzJq0U.jpg" title="at STY vol.14|某次文化节，和一些小事儿"><span class="type">下一篇</span> <span class="category"><i class="ic i-flag"></i> at-STY</span><h3>at STY vol.14|某次文化节，和一些小事儿</h3></a></div></div><div class="wrap" id="comments"></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><div class="panels"><div class="inner"><div class="contents panel pjax" data-title="文章目录"><ol class="toc"><li class="toc-item toc-level-1"><a class="toc-link" href="#intro"><span class="toc-number">1.</span> <span class="toc-text">Intro</span></a></li><li class="toc-item toc-level-1"><a class="toc-link" href="#the-story"><span class="toc-number">2.</span> <span class="toc-text">The story</span></a><ol class="toc-child"><li class="toc-item toc-level-2"><a class="toc-link" href="#i-something-is-wrong"><span class="toc-number">2.1.</span> <span class="toc-text">I.
