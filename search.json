准备\n2024年清明节前的某一天，STY收到了班长群里的消息说我校即将举办中华文化节，每班要出个摊位。将此事交代班主任和一些能出谋划策的同学之后，他们进行了充分的意见交流，最后……\n> STY：所以你们说的是套圈儿吗？（转发一张庙会套圈的图）\n> 某同学：是滴捏。\n> STY：这玩意儿能有多少传统文化特色……\n> 某同学：你去编嘛。\n> STY：😀。6\n但也不能真是套圈儿吧！于是STY硬凑了几个活动：\n- **冷门文常问答**：找人出了25个文常的题，一个个都有点逆天。\n- **套圈**：就是正常套圈，没有套路。对了，其实有一个套路，就是活动场地地面太滑了，一般人根本套不上。\n- **求签**：￥14.5买了一筒关于考试运气的签，里面特别放了几个**下下下下下下下签**。\n- **剪纸**：找个理由来消耗一个儿童剪纸套装。\n- **传统服饰展示**：害，就是指我们班有人穿汉服，就酱。\n![alt text](https://img2.imgtp.com/2024/04/20/5L0gCGp7.jpg \"STY准备的家伙事儿。求签筒里有一个“下下下下下下下签”\")\n好啦，然后就是做一个简简单单的海报！STY班主任称:\n> 老师：随便做一下就行了\n> STY: 好的收到👌\n\n成品be like：\n- 背景是一张超级大纸，纸上啥东西都没画\n- 上面贴了5张A4纸，4张是活动内容，1张是水地方用的，当做留言。\n- 没啦~\n## 活动中\n本次活动在熟悉的报告厅进行，上次见这个报告厅是在[义卖那篇](https://ameitsu.github.io/at-STY/at-STY/%E4%B9%89%E5%8D%96%E6%99%92%E5%8D%95/)。预计这个地方过一个月会有一次大改造，期待啊喵。\n\n![alt text](https://img2.imgtp.com/2024/04/20/RGk2zmBB.jpg \"准备中\")\n\n直到这个时候STY才发现本班活动的详细安排有且仅有STY一个人知道……问题不大！\n\n和STY预料的一样，我自己想好的活动安排没有一个可以完整开展的。但是套圈除外——我没想到报告厅地面滑得那么恰到好处。\n\n收拾好以后STY就自己去玩了，当然也不讲武德地参加了自己班的项目，拿着标准答案回答问题，给后面的人整懵了。\n![alt

非常好食堂，爱来自■京市■■区\n我校食堂已经被高一同学们冲了。为什么只有高一出动呢？因为**高二觉得已经有改善了，高三考一模呢**。\n\n我校是一所伙食在■■区中富有特色的学校。在毕业之后，那些从海内外名校回来探望老师的同学们无不怀念这里的午饭，算是一种忆苦思甜。光是翻一翻学校贴吧就能知道这些饭饭给了当时的学生们多少反向感动，尤其是那个2010年左右的“硫酸白菜”，太那个了。\n\nSTY这一届从小学以来就听说了我校食堂在家长群体中的赫赫威名。挺多家长都想出了解决食堂问题的妙计，诸如自己带饭（学校：安全不能保证），家长负责食堂（■■餐饮：那我走？），模仿我校竞争对手■京市第■■中学（学校：其实■■中的和咱们没什么区别）。但很明显无事发生。\n\n不过，今年家长们整了个大活儿。跟着一件STY不好评价的**四·〇一事件**，部分家长联名上书要和学校谈餐饮问题，并且最终的确有一次座谈会被举办。结果说学校要搞什么AB餐制，期待一波儿。\n\n与此同时，高一同学们在午餐评价表上输出自己对食堂负责人和午餐的问候，虽然我站没有任何内容审核机制，但是STY觉得这些话也不适合放出来。最终……学校撤了评价表，换上了意见箱。比较良心的事——**楼道里摄像头没有对准意见箱**。\n\n## STY男娘说\n真的，有人在askbox里问我想不想当男娘。太内个了。但是也不是不能考虑一下……\n:::info\n还是当猫娘更好。\n:::\n\n## 五一外出计划\nSTY在校内报了英语视听说选修课。STY做出这一选择不是为了学，纯粹是因为老师以《英国铁路之旅》为主要教学内容，这把作为railfan的STY激动得不行。毕设是拍一个■京的铁路vlog，而我们小组成员将在五一火速出动前往■京老城区拍摄。`@STY`安排！目前计划的路线为奥森->奥运场馆区->南锣鼓巷->什刹海->鼓楼->前门。\n\n## 怎么就期中考试了！\n

disaster films, The day after tomorrow  have obsessed audiences who worries about a potential doomsday since 2004 —— yeah, of course along with that 2012, which is also directed by the same director, Roland Emmerich.  \n\nSet in the backdrop of a rapid decrease in temperature ironically caused by global warming, the film illustrated a familiar world devastated by never-before-seen blizzards. As people became more aware in global warming around 2004, therefore the film was praised of alerting people the deadly consequence of a global scale climate change. The special effect of the film, especially the panorama of the frozen New York City and the vast tornado clusters that wiped Los Angeles off the map, stunned the eyes of the audiences in the time when such technologies were indeed quite rare. Yet exactly 20 years later, as the global warming continues and global situations gradually altered, we might need to re-watch the film with today’s eyes.\n# The story\nTo start with, it is apparent that this film is certainly another superhero-like story that emphasized heroism. Anyway, the plot can be divided into the following chapters:\n##\tI. Something is wrong!\nJack Hall, a paleoclimatologist, completed a model of the prehistoric climate change, and suggested the current rate of global warming might cause a disorder in the global ocean current system like the ancient case, directly leading to a rapid ice age. With snowfall in New Delhi, hailstone in Tokyo and showers in New York, the climate was malfunctioning then. \n##\tII. Tragedies and meaningless waiting\nWithin several days, most sectors of Los Angeles were wiped off the map by a cluster of tornados. Upcoming was the sudden plunge in temperature in the North Atlantic Drift. Then rain showered New York for three continuous days. The climate was undoubtedly ill. Everything happened proved Jack’s assumption, yet no one listened to him. \n##\tIII. The blizzard\nThree British military helicopters malfunctioned and downed above the highlands of Scotland, as the eye of an extraordinary snow storm hit the British Isles. It was -110°C there. The shower in New York turned into a blizzard. Lower Manhattan was submerged, trapping Jack’s son, Sam. Sam alongside with his friends sought shelter in the New York City Library, and had to burn books to stay warm. \n##\tIV. The extraction\nRight before the meteorology lab was struck by the blizzard, Jack finished all tasks and determined to save his son. He succeeded though, yet one teammate of him sacrificed himself on the. \n##\tV. Aftermath\nThe entire northern hemisphere was buried by snow, therefore US citizens fled to Mexico. After the storm dissolved, the US government-in-exile sent forces to recover the survivors. The earth entered the second Ice Age.\n# Impressions\n##\tBackground\nOne of the most stunning aspects – and one of the most boring one - is that the film is based on a 100% truth: global warming. There’s a good reason why this can be both advantage and disadvantage: global warming seemed too far away from daily lives in many people’s perspective, therefore omitting its consequence, and that is what the film all about. A second Ice Age is over sensational however, yet the unexplored and deadly potential of the delicate climate system is well-illustrated.\n##\tMankind’s efforts\nIn the film 2012, we witnessed how selfish humans were during disasters, yet in The day after tomorrow the noble sides of humans were greatly emphasized. While government officials denied Jack’s proposal to evacuate half of the US, groups of insightful researchers joined Jack and began to analyze the storm; Meteorologists continued their survey on seawater temperatures until they exhausted all supplies; Ambulances were sent even after the blizzard hit northern US. There are always people who care about mankind and it is an unquestionably truth rather than an artistic illustration. After all, we have been through the COVID-19, and we still memorize the ones who risked their lives for the lives of others.\n##\tThe catastrophe\nThe thing that hit earth wasn’t a normal blizzard at all - it is actually a snowing hurricane. The sheer scale of the blizzard definitely evoked audiences’ megaphobia. Furthermore, the eye of the blizzard reached the lowest temperature of -110°C, while currently the most freezing spot on the Earth was just -90°C. This contrast between reality and fiction obviously astonished viewers. Mother nature certainly can turn her back on us, though not as catastrophic as the blizzards in the film, yet we are constantly observing odd weather phenomena like the double el niño. Perhaps a catastrophe would really loom our delicate world one day.\n##\tThe world \nIn 2012, we have seen how all world landmarks became destroyed, how all the tectonic plates shifted in one day, how the two poles changed direction, in the hands of Roland Emmerich. And in The day after tomorrow we observed how Europe was covered under 4 meters of snow, how New York was submerged under sea ice, how the entire northern hemisphere became white. Americans fled to Mexico, which is an ironic scene compared with reality. Seeing the civilization, the place we live in and beloved ones coming to an end is assuredly more painful than being frozen in the storm.\n# Real-world connections\n##\tGlobal warming\nDisaster films’ directors tend to set the background with abnormal events, for instance super volcanoes and asteroid collisions. Nevertheless, this film is based on the phenomena that affected mankind for decades – global warming. Indeed, the climate system is changing. In Beijing alone, we experienced the lowest temperature in 60 years, the highest temperature since 1961 and the largest rainfall in the past 2 centuries in only two years. However, we are seeing changes. As renewable energy, anti-pollution movements and international cooperation roll out, we certainly have a promising future. It is more likely that the global scale blizzard won’t be formed, still, we have to cope with the chaotic weathers. \n##\tInheriting our culture\nTo stay warm, Jack’s son, Sam, reluctantly burned books with friends and remaining librarians. Sam was confused when he saw one of the librarians held the Guttenberg Bible tight with his hands, preventing it from being burnt. The librarian claimed that the book symbolized the new era of western culture as it is the first printed book in Europe and he could actually preserve a piece of the precious history with a tiny effort. That reminds people of the critical function of culture. As long as the culture’s bloodline continues, hope will be there with the people. That is part of the reason how China defeated Japanese invasion, how Simon Bolívar and San Martin liberated South America, how the Allies gained victory from the Axis in WWII……. Culture is an intangible and priceless thing that defined humanity, therefore inheriting it is our utmost mission for our next generation.\n##\tResponsibility of going reverse\nAfter New York froze, Jack resolutely packed his polar gear to start his expedition to that inaccessible city. Surely, he wanted to save his trapped son, however another reason  is that he needs to inspect the status of the northern lands. During that time, the eventual National Disaster Order had been issued, large numbers of US citizens were relocated into the south, even the US government members were transferred to Mexico, there seemed no reason of advancing reversely into the blizzard. Yet the responsibility within propelled Jack and his teammates to start the literally impossible mission. In the reality, during epidemics such as COVID-19 and various major earthquakes, courageous pioneers who risked their lives and rushed into affected zones for search-and-rescue missions are commonly seen.  Responsibility of going reverse is not an obligation for everyone, but when it comes to those critical moments, it is the internal bond that keeps humans united.\n##\tFlee or fight?\n“Flee or fight” is originally a psychological term, which describes the rapid decision between doing something and keeping safe made by one’s instinct in case of emergency. In the film, hopeless survivors of the New York rain who gathered in the City Library met a dilemma: Though the library provided a shelter for them, the water outside began to freeze under low temperature, forming a viable path to escape the city. Therefore, most of the people started to leave the library. Yet Sam already received the warning from his father, saying that staying indoors is a lot safer. In the end, Sam and other people remaining indoors survived until Sam’s father arrived, while the ones who left earlier were all frozen. When meeting such occasions when you are forced to make tough choices, consider carefully between “flee” and “fight”. Always remember to survive the main trouble first, and in terms of the rest, just let it go.\n##\tMankind and Earth\nHumans are among the species in the galaxy that dominated an entire planet. We believed that we could harness and exploit the planet that we stand on, as humans bridged rivers, rerouted waterways, transformed landscapes in millennia of exploration. Nevertheless, we sometimes underestimate the mighty force of mother nature. In the film, the US vice president rejected Jack’s proposal of combating with global warming as he believed that their economy was far more important. Productivity indeed is the internal power that shapes human society, even so, we should not override nature. After all, humans are just over-evolved apes, consuming our habitat is the worst thing we can ever do. \n##\tTrusting someone’s competence\nIn the film, the vice president of US didn’t accept Jack’s plan, as he believed knowledge about economy and policies are better in this blizzard; Jack’s boss denied Jack’s access to super computers, as he thought Jack was only a guy who research ancient weather, not present ones; Sam failed a calculus test because he didn’t write any solutions, since the teacher couldn’t do calculus in his mind therefore, he anticipated Sam couldn’t and cheated. When someone claimed to have capabilities in something, just let him or her testify.\n# Film- related trivial stuff\n##\tRoland Emmerich\nHe is the person who destroys Earth better than anyone. The day after tomorrow, 2012, and Moonfall are several of his disaster films. The day after tomorrow gathered people’s attention on urgent environment issues, and 2012 pictured a doomsday according to the Mayan calendar, and even spelled fear among people! And Moonfall …… that was totally an accident, as audiences are getting bored about seeing earth being rampaged time after time.\n##\tHeroism\nThe film portraited one saint – Jack Hall. He seemed to know everything about the blizzard, forecasted long before its arrival, and could traverse ice-sealed Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersy. In a word, these feats just seemed unreal. In modern times, literally nothing can be done solo. Cooperation is the thing matters since we are humans that can assist each other. \n##\tPlot\nWell, not complicated though. That is another reason of its success – simple to understand, so that viewers’ brains are able to enjoy the sound and visual effects. But the storyline is so typical that it can be applied on literally any similar films: a genius found something odd, then this genius told others but no one listened, and tragedy come, and everyone is saved by the genius. It would be better if there are more twists and jump-scares.\n# Conclusion\nOverall, The day after tomorrow is a thrilling film in terms of special effects, depth in content and imagination, even reflected numerous real-life issues. However, lacking ingenuity in plot and the emphasize on heroism are main targets of criticism. It truly outstands among all those disaster films. The end.\n\n{%raw%}\n<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n        repo=\"ameitsu/ameitsu.github.io\"\n        issue-term=\"title\"\n        label=\"Comments\"\n

1\n近年来“预判”一词的出现频率愈发增加，小到学生对学习目标和人生的计划，大至国家的五年规划的制订与环境变化的预测，可见无论对个人、社会或是国家，随波逐流并非明智之举，唯有审时度势的预判才是正道。\n# 2\n预判是根据当下规律性的情况，对未来的趋势的判断。它区别于猜测与推知：未来的局面尚不可知，而影响未来的线索又纷繁复杂，又不同于的解题。而对于一个合理又精准的预判、远景、宏观性和应变是不可或缺的元素。\n# 3\n预判有了前瞻性，才能让人跳出面前的局势或境况、判断未来。上世纪六七十年代的中国一穷二白，国家却也发展核工业，这正是一种高瞻远瞩：“两弹一星”的成功使中国后来成为独立自主的泱泱大国带来可能。面对2008年的金融危机，雷军并未拘泥于困境中，而是大胆预测了未来移动互联网产业的崛起，这才有了小米公司。预判，必须有前瞻的视野，倘不依发展之“预”，谋长远之“判”，怎能顺应时代之潮？\n# 4\n有了高瞻远瞩，便能使预判生效，同时全局性也应体现在预判之中。计算机中央处理器分配线程内存，需要预判整台设备的需求；国家推行“五位一体”的规划，也是出于对经济、社会，生态等角度做出的综合预测。倘若计算机只预测部分设备的情况，国家只顾经济高速发展，造成的资源浪费只会愈发严重。这充分说明即使情况纷繁复杂，顾及全局的预判也是正道。\n# 5\n除此之外，灵活性的预判有助于提高预判的精准性。皇佑二年，杭州饥荒，新上任的州长官范仲淹面对灾情时并没有死板地下令开仓放粮，而是综合评判了浙江当时的情况：浙江余粮甚多，而大多囤积在富人和寺庙手中，缺乏流通；放粮会引起这些人的反感而使赈灾无法正常进行。因此，他预判到大幅度提高物价以吸引粮商运粮至杭州可平衡供需关系，让粮价自然回落，又不引起矛盾，这正也是范仲淹最终成功的破局之策。人们往往局限在由过去经验构筑的条条框框中，而灵活变通地寻求破局之策才有可能使预判精准命中问题之眼。\n# 6\n预判，要求前瞻性，全局性与灵活性有机结合：不前瞻则丧失预判的根基，不全局则局限格局眼界，不灵活则易陷入死局而不知，利用前瞻性预判未来变化之方向，运用全局性预判整体性的局面，活用灵活性预判变化的变化，才能远离目光短浅的困境、繁杂混乱的乱境、捉襟见肘的窘境。\n# 7\n总而言之，预判的重要性不言而喻，而预判也要求前瞻性，全局性和灵活性三位一体。正处于世界未有之大变局和科技赋能社会之现状的我们更应做到这三点，为人生谋篇布局，开未来之正路。\n\n{%raw%}\n<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n        repo=\"ameitsu/ameitsu.github.io\"\n

Antarctica","url":"/Ameitsu-Orchestra/ameitsu-orchestra/AmeistuOrchestra vol-8/","content":":::info\n这依然是某一次的英语作业。\n:::\n\n# Scott of Antarctica: The ill-fated warrior against nature\nA year-round Antarctic station became fully operational in November 1956, and occupying the southernmost point of the place where we stand since the furthest history: the south pole. Though Constructed by US National Science Foundation, the station wasn’t named using any great American figure’s name, instead they used two literally immortal names of humanity: Amundsen and Scott.\n## The two warriors\nThe two men were both explorers, whose expertise were searching the frontier of the Earth. Amundsen was the first human to reach the south pole, and  certainly he looked like the perfect person ever to accomplish this epic mission, since he had just navigated the icy waters of Canadian Northwest and Yukon. He seemed so well-prepared and fortunate, therefore people often focus on the deceased loser of the race to the south pole —— Captain Scott.\n# Scott's voyage\nSubsequent to Scott’s death, Amundsen mourned him and commented that Scott was the embodiment of all great characters of humans. Scott is famed for his unsuccessful expedition to the pole, and there is certainly a reason for it. Scott’s team encountered mechanical failures of their motorized sledges right after their departure, and facing challenges when you have just started is never better than failing it completely. After marching in the icy Antarctic plateaus in low mood for two months, they witnessed the scenario that none of the teammates would imagine: Amundsen arrived with a Norwegian flag already. This accounted for the second punch on their ambitions. The true despair occurred on their way back. With days passing by, the men soon realized the frightening fact that all supplies were in shortage. The explorers gradually slowed down the progress and eventually watched how fellow teammates die before them. And finally, the finale: Scott spent the final hours of himself to write the one last letter to his loved wife and son.\n# What can we say\nSince his death, opinions claiming Scott’s crude decision-making ability accounted for the tragedy were widely spread. Undoubtedly, it is a truth: Scott decided to use Yakut ponies and powered sledges rather than the safest option of skis and dogs, despite being warned by Amundsen prior to his departure. Nevertheless, he still deserved the title as the hero of Antarctica. The thing that powered Scott within was the spirit of endeavor and self-sacrificing. Regardless of the miserable beginning, the team managed to reach the destination. This is a character shared by all explorers from Christopher Columbus in the Atlantic to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin up on the moon. Nothing burdensome could be accomplished without endeavor, not to mention traversing Antarctica. Soon after the men became aware about their destiny, they kept on and collected a total of 20 kilograms of precious stones that could possibly prove Antarctica’s geological history as a vibrant world rather than a snowy wasteland, saving considerable time and efforts for succeeding researchers. Resigning to their fate, the last two men, including Scott, breathed their final breath in a blizzard of 1912, yet they have already achieved more than attempting to reach the south pole: Not just researched Antarctica, but also explored the limit of human beings’ might. Failing never meant an unfortunate conclusion, those failed on their pathway of pursuing a greater good are the ones that ignited the flame of hope to guide the rest. And that is exactly the story of captain Robert Falcon Scott, the martyr on human’s way of conquering unknown. \n\n{%raw%}\n<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n

1\n北京是一个“盛产”名人故居的城市。在内城的一些犄角旮旯里你总能与某个有名的老邻居不期而遇，在这雨儿胡同里也一样。\n## 2\n院子虽不起眼，但其主人却是中国艺术史上殿堂级的人物——齐白石；巷道虽不出名，但不远却是老城最繁华的街道之一——南锣鼓巷，院内的狭小和静谧与南锣鼓巷似乎不在同一时空中：南锣鼓巷里网红店里人头攒动，人流熙熙攘攘；而院里只有白墙灰瓦的呢喃和岁月侵蚀的刻痕，如同史书一般，寂静的仿佛停滞在那位艺术家仍健在的时光。\n齐白石旧居是一座三合院——甚至比巷子里的许多院落少一“合”。一进院落，再穿入内门，就来到了旧居的核心——袖珍而简朴。旧居也几乎保留着时光的倒影，一切都像齐白石老人才刚出门一般真实且生动。从窗棂上斜射几束阳光，随意抚摸着展台上摊开的卷轴，定睛一看，是那些活在齐白石老人轶事中的那些虾。再回头望向屋内，赭石色的齐白石雕像恍忽间似刚起身。\n## 3\n齐白石老人身上有一些难以忽视的标签：飘乎世外，似乎不属于二十世纪，齐白石在镜头前几乎都是这一身行头：深蓝长袍马褂，金丝圆框眼镜，即便在建国后也如此，堪比行走的历史照片。老人的创作也几乎从未打断，甚至在兵荒马乱的年代里他产出了最巅峰的作品。人们道听途说抑或是孩子们从课本上阅读到的轶事，也几乎都是关于那些名作的诞生，鲜少有关于他起居生活的故事，似乎齐白石就是他手中的那杆毛笔的化身。身为人民艺术家的齐白石有如此超乎普通人的气质，更让这间平平无奇的三合小院更加与众不同。\n一个人的事业体现一个人的气质，而超脱世俗的齐白石也是其艺术所成就的。\n## 4\n齐白石是人民艺术家的一员，也常以古稀老者的形象闻名于世，俨然一副国画大家的面貌。这尽管是不可争认的事实，但人们在脑海中浮现出的国画家形象往往是不苟言笑、性格古怪、故作高深的，而齐白石则是例外，齐白石画作的浓厚乡土气息，天真浪漫的童心富有余味的诗意，构成了作品的内在生命与齐白石的精神内核。而那热烈明快的色彩，墨与色的强烈对比，浑拙的造型和笔法、工与写的极端，则是作品的外在生命与齐白石刚中有柔的老者形象的体现。这二者的合璧，既构成了齐白石的艺术生涯，更有他的人生。艺术意味着呼唤人性中最初的美好，由人的本能，即从对美的认识出发感知世界，这正是成就齐白石和他能流芳千古的原因。\n## 5\n能与时代的精神统一得完美无暇，这是齐白石在中国画上难能可贵的功绩。他既赋予作品童真与质朴清新的农民情感，也赋予文人画以现代性与生命力。从他对画虾的琢磨，到开创 “红花墨叶”的大写意风格，他所做的正是拉近“文雅”与“世俗”，赋予中国画全新的活力，发展中国画的创造性画法与面向广大人民的创作使其真正成为一名人民艺术家，与那个时代生机蓬勃的精神共鸣。同时齐白石在抗战中坚守作画的原则，拒绝向侵略者卖画，而在抗美援朝义卖上他却捐出大量画作，他与时代精神的共振也不言而喻。艺术不仅是个人精神的辐射，更是与时代精神相统一甚至是构建时代精神本身的途径。\n## 6\n爱与和平，也是这位大家的作品中时常做客的主题。《百花与和平鸽》《和平胜利》《和平万岁》《和平颂》……一个个“和平”虽然的确受到抗战、解放战争乃至冷战的影响，但能如此热爱世界的大同，齐白石老人的确有过人之处。在当时的时代背景下，能对和平抱有如此大的热情，除了齐白石老人自身心系全人类，更少不了他的艺术对他的潜移默化。还是“红花墨叶”，花开叶生在红与黑的极致对撞中尽显无留；还是他的虾，似柔实刚、乱中有序，自然界的奇迹之一，生命的挥洒，被展现得淋漓尽致。艺术使人回归到那些纯真的美好中，感受这个充满奇迹的世界，感受到作为人类能观察到这一切是多么幸运……于是争端和战争就显得冗余了。艺术是将个人的精神与全人类的共同精神相结合的过程，正如齐白石在充满童真和乡土气息的作品中追求人们自古以来共同向往的和平。\n## 7\n于是，就有了这么一位传奇的国画大师。在逝世近七十年后，他的故事依然活在道听途说的故事中，活在课本的文章中，刻在几处纪念堂和故居中，依然被大人和孩子们所知。也许被人铭记本身就是成就，但齐白石身上有着一些比这些都值得留念的。\n## 8\n所以我们又回到了艺术上。至今依然有人追求艺术——也许齐白石老人也对这感到满意，但艺术在一些人群中逐渐向一种花瓶般的摆设演进：考取了演奏某种乐器的等级证书，只是为了综合素质评价上“特长”一栏能多出几句话，甚至这件乐器在平时都鲜少拿起；去了美术馆，只是为了一张“宣传照”，显得自己的情操是如此的超乎大众……这时齐白石老人就能成为当代的一个榜样了。艺术从来不是一项展示自己的成就，而是为了发掘人性最初的美好，是建设美好社会的责任，更是将个人的精神世界与全人类的相结合的过程。除此之外，生活中的艺术似乎也在褪色：固然有大量艺术作品的产出，但在信息化时代它们又被淹没在无尽的数据流中；音乐和美术科目总被占，这是一个不争的尴尬事实……确实有理由解释，但艺术作为人类本能的延伸，需要占据生活的一席之地。齐白石老人的虾，他的花，使他领略自然的美好，从而心胸愈发宽广……这正是艺术的力量的体现。\n## 9\n现在看来，纪念齐白石这位雨儿胡同的故人，更是纪念艺术本身，呼唤艺术在某种程度上的重归。\n## 10\n夜幕降临，行人逐渐减少，雨儿胡同也逐渐平静下来。离巷口不远的地方，一座三合院的灯火依然通明，如同那个曾经住过的故人在艺术上发出的光芒。\n\n{%raw%}\n<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n

STY奇文共赏之锐评■京地铁","url":"/uncategorized/ameitsu-orchestra/AmeistuOrchestra vol-6/","content":":::info\n但凡多看几篇您就会知道咱这儿的 **“■京”** 实为中国北京市。原则上所有的“北京”都得替换成“■京”，但这篇是**唯一的例外**。蟹蟹。\n:::\n:::default\n这是STY的寒假地理作业之一。\n:::\n# 新的阶段，新的布局：一个研究性学习\n——从地理必修二的内容分析北京地铁新线对区域发展的影响\n# 一．\t引入\n每年的十二月底，有一些值得期待的事情在北京发生：圣诞节、跨年、元旦假期……还有一个“保留节目”是北京地铁开通几条新线路或车站。自从2016年最后一天16号线北段开通以来，北京的地铁网络密度显著提升，同时此后开通的其他线路也具有显著的共性与和既有线的明显差别。这些新的变化既显现北京地铁的全新布局思路，更有利于北京的区域发展，尤其是南北向的沟通。\n\n高中地理教材必修二第四章介绍了一些交通运输布局的原则、区域发展和交通运输布局的互相影响等内容。我们可以从这些角度出发，分析新线路的布局和设备等特点如何优化了北京交通网络的布局与城区协调发展。\n\n# 二．\t北京地铁新线的特点和区域交通布局的原则\n此处提到的北京地铁新线，指的是16、17、19号线。不难得出这三条线具有如下七个共性： \n-\t站距较大：三条线平均站距分别为1.71、2.87、2.32千米，高于大部分线路的平均站距。\n-\t运营速度较快：列车最高速度在80-100千米每小时之间，显著高于其他列车。\n-\t南北走向：16号线从西北方向的北安河延伸到西南方向的宛平城，17号线从偏东北的未来科学城延伸到东南的亦庄，19号线从牡丹园纵贯北京核心区到新宫。\n-\t全地下线：三条线的每一座车站均位于地下，中途无地面或高架部分。车辆段全封闭或有上盖，轨道上方一直有建筑物遮盖，也可视为地下。\n-\t车辆载客量大：三条线的车辆都是8A编组。从车厢数上说，这高于其他线路6节车厢的配置；从宽度上看，A车厢的宽度大于B车厢，即载客量更大。\n-\t沿途交通枢纽多：16号线上的国家图书馆站、17号线的十里河站、19号线的草桥站等均为三条线路交汇的大站，同时16号线在北京丰台站设站、19号线在新宫接驳大兴机场线。\n-\t连接新开发地区：丽泽商务区、经开区、海淀后山等新区位于三条线附近。\n而根据必修二教材，交通网络的布局应满足这五条原则：\n-\t条件制约：既有技术装备和经济发展条件，也有地质等自然条件。\n-\t运输需求：不仅是目前的交通运输实际，也需要满足未来可能的需求或者说适度超前建设。\n-\t节约土地：站点和线路应尽量少占用土地，尤其是耕地。\n-\t综合体系：和不同交通运输方式衔接，形成立体的交通运输网络。\n-\t平衡区域：连接新开发地区或欠开发地区到市中心，拉近这些地区与城市中心区的经济发展差距。\n\n# 三．\t北京地铁新线如何落实这些原则\n前文提到的五个原则在北京地铁的三条新线上得到了体现。\n\n在技术层面，三条新线采用了全新的DKZ93和CCD5034等8A编组列车与自动化技术。增大的车厢与增加的车长势必会大幅提高单列车的载客量与运输效率。以DKZ93为例，该车型单列车载客量为2480人，而6B编组的DKZ13载客量却仅有1424人。17和19号线均为自动线路，自动化控制的线路使车辆调度更加灵敏，能做到在高峰期时压缩发车间隔，优化高峰期运行效率。总的来说，全新的装备增大运输效率，对跨区域尤其是长距离运输更加有针对性。\n\n交通运输需求在这三条线上也得到了满足。从目前建成区间来看，16号线服务于西部地区，覆盖此前仅有4号线途经的海淀后山与最近几年才开工建设的丽泽商务区，而这些地区因此前缺少地铁线路而有较大的交通运输需求。17号线虽然目前分南北段开通，但两段均有“热点”地区：北段，工人体育场作为体育赛事和文艺活动承办场所是重要的目的地；南端，位于亦庄的站点是新的通勤起始点，服务于经开区。19号线的作用之一，就是填补了先前大兴机场线只到草桥的遗憾，满足中心城区和北部城区居民前往南部大兴机场的需求。可见，三条线路都满足了特定的交通运输需求。\n\n鉴于三条线均为地下线路，大量土地资源得以保留。地面和高架线路的车站规模虽然小于地下线路，但鉴于地面和高架车站和线路之外需要设置隔离区，实际上占用的地面空间仍大于地下线路，因为地下线路占用的土地资源仅为若干个出入口的部分。这三条线路服务于开发区，因此地下线路节约土地资源的特点更是其优势。\n\n三条线路的部分枢纽站使不同线路或交通方式得到了较好的结合。最明显的是，北京地铁全路网三线换乘站8个中有4个位于这三条线上，路网结构得到改善，客流纾解更容易，因为乘客可前往的方向增多。16号线上的丰台站使乘客可通过地铁系统抵达周边无快速路、交通相对不便的丰台站；17号线附近有亦庄T1有轨电车，也和亦庄线接驳，在远期亦庄火车站如果开通，则能连接京津城际，促进亦庄内外部交通发展；19号线在草桥站接驳大兴机场线，而大兴机场线的目的地更是不言而喻。\n\n最后，三条线路做到了平衡区域发展。16号线将海淀山后、三里河行政中心区、北京丰台站、北京丽泽金融商务区、丰台科技园等重要城市功能区相连；17号线加强经开区和未来科学城与主城区的联系；19号线通过与大兴机场线协调，为大兴机场和空港开发区与城区的连接提供交通保障。\n\n# 四．\t新的变化如何作用于北京区域发展\n既然要平衡区域发展，那么有区域间的连接、在有需要的区域之间连接、有快速高效的连接是需要的。\n首先，在形成连接方面，三条线路均在若干城区外围开发区和居民区与城市核心区间形成运输通道。之所以强调单独的形成连接，是因为在既有交通设施上开设线路没有使用全新独立交通设施的交通方式运行效率高，而运输效率是促进区域发展中人员流动的重要因素。\n其次，就是连接区域的选择。16号线上既有海淀后山地区这样的轨道交通交通欠发达地区，也有丽泽商务区等新开发区，当然还经过主城区的金融街附近，这些地区都具有重要发展潜力和交通需求，16号线通过满足交通需求有助于挖掘这些潜力。17和19号线都经过先前是一片“空白”的南部新城，对于拉进这些新城区与城市核心区的作用更加显而易见。通过将有需求有潜力的地区和城区连接，区域发展能进一步平衡。\n最后和最主要的是运输效率。车辆选择、运行方式和接驳线路都是决定运输效率的重要因素，而三条新线兼顾了这三点。在车辆上，三条线路均使用8A编组，提高近千人的载客量；在运行方式上，三条线路的列车采用较高的速度运行，同时17和19号线采取自动驾驶模式，更易调度；在接驳线路上，三条线路均有大型的三线换乘站，16号线与国家铁路接驳，17号线与城区局部的有轨电车联运，19号线通过机场联络线可与机场相连。更高的速度，更大的载客量，更灵活的控制使线路自身的运输效率得以提高，而更多的换乘站和多元化的交通方式结合促进客流的疏导。运输效率提高，自然使人员进出新区更加容易。\n\n# 五．\t展望\n北京地铁的16、17、19三条新线说明北京地铁面对未来北京区域发展做出了改变：从小站距改为大站距，甚至出现“交而不换”的现象，通过减少停靠增快运营速度；改用大容量高速度的列车，适应新区发展的通勤需求；完善南北走向大型干线，平衡北部城区与南部新城和城市核心区的发展；形成交通枢纽分散分布的格局。而这些改变对于平衡区域发展，促进区域间人员流通，及时纾解客流也是至关重要的。\n随着北京地铁新一轮建设的进行，平衡区域发展作为北京地铁的重要作用将促使更多类似16、17、19号线的大型快速干线出现，拉近区域间的连接。\n\n{%raw%}\n<script

begin with……\n终于，这个小破站撑到了一周年。在一周年之际，写点特别的东西是肯定的。只是STY刚考完期末考试，物理化学生物集体难度upup，其他文科的题目怪让人疑神疑鬼的，所以STY已经处于萎靡不振的状态了，也自然煽情不起来。!!谁™出的破卷子(`皿´＃)!!\n# 这一年\n本站是一个普普通通的，拿Hexo整出来的一个个人网站。Hexo一个月116k下载，去除掉数量可观的失败案例外，剩下的正在运行的也不在少数。STY用的是Github Pages部署，还保留Github Pages的原始仓库url，让这个小破站更显得更加破了。\n\n虽然它又小又破，但是——已经**一周年了**！这说明Cyberpark在STY心中的地位还是不一样的。\n\nSTY想建一个个人网站的计划始于2021年。当时STY知道要解决服务器问题，但资金确实看起来挺捉襟见肘。在2022年左右，STY接触到了Hexo，一种轻量化的静态网站生成框架——而且可部署在Github Pages上！\n\n建设计划从2022年下半年开始实施。但遇到的问题挺多：有时SSH会报错，Github Pages也经常失联，几乎每一次Git都会报错。因此，建设计划被迫暂时停止，直到2023年初。经过一系列的推倒重做，最终STY建成了第一个属于自己的网站——Ameitsu Cyberpark。Ameitsu取自自己名字的诡异日语训读，Cyberpark其实就是Cyberpunk的变体，意为这是一个开辟在信息世界中STY的后花园。\n\n最初的Cyberpark采用的是黑白配色很contemporary的Next主题。但是STY其实想要的是更花里胡哨的Shoka主题，不过因为初代Cyberpark仅为实验品，STY先用简单的功能试一试。\n\n在2023年1月21日晚，壬寅年的最后一天，Cyberpark正式上线。当时，我们就有了第一位观众——后来线下催更这些事也都是ta做的。\n\n建站初的九天，STY更新了7篇。最重要的是第一篇游记，STY仍然觉得那天首钢的天空和湖水难以忘怀。\n\n后来，初三下学期开始了。最后的四个月里，各种大考分割了时间。STY认为保持更新不现实——但很明显我错了。那篇“断更宣言”也成了笑话。更新网站和专注学习并不是冲突的，毕竟我™还是能掂量自己几斤几两。\n大考后，STY都会发一篇@STY锐评试题，有时也有SofTY文章分享一下STY做的技术狠活……那也是快乐的日子。\n\n直升后，Cyberpark依旧是业余生活中重要的一环。STY也是在这时打出了本站的第一个广告。据目前追踪到的消息，那个广告在我年级受到了一定的关注，也难怪分班后新同学也认得那个url。\n\n暑假开始后，STY才真正感到内容产出有多难。首先，全暑假最重量级的Ameitsu Orchestra第一篇耗费了三个晚上的苦思冥想才最终完成；其次，AO真正的第二篇也胎死腹中，AO暂时沦为水刊，成了作业和破作文的集散地；更别提，预定的更新计划完全没有得到实施……\n\n而且这种混沌的状态持续到了高一。虽然这时的Cyberpark已经改为Shoka主题，甚至是STY爆改的，有了一位“撰稿人”，分出了专题，安装了多个插件，但STY能感觉出这个小破站是在走下坡路了。多个专栏被鸽了，整个12月只有一篇占位置的文章——不太乐观的亚子。\n\n但是，我们有**信心**！这是唯一属于STY的电子后花园！\n\n愿这座后花园能在寒假时光的滋润中重开色彩。\n\n愿在未来的365天中她能继续走下去。\n\nCyberpark明天会更好！\n\n{%raw%}<hr>{%endraw%}\n**Ameitsu**，写于2024年1月21日\n\n就酱。","tags":["站庆"],"categories":["站内页面"]},{"title":"at

突围\n\n人类的历史就是人类突破层层限制的斗争史。在这部人类破除对未知自然的恐惧、联系大陆之间彼此、革新观念和生产力的史诗中，作为笔墨的正是我们突围的努力。\n\n突围是指人发挥主观能动性，突破眼前困难与局限，从而开辟全新天地的过程。虽然人们往往着眼于为了突围而做出的措施，然而对突围起到更加决定性作用的是一以贯之的努力：没有恒定的目标引领、没有坚持突围的信心、没有持续发力的努力，任何方法都会付诸东流。突围，需要一以贯之。\n\n突围要破除层层困境，一以贯之的目标是必须的。如今，“天问一号”的成功人尽皆知，而鲜为人知的是，在天问一号10年前，一次完全失败的火星探测任务——“萤火一号”——使地面上的中国团队意识到确定一个明确的火星探索以及突破运载火箭等瓶颈技术的目标有多么重要，“绕、落、巡”三步走的火星探测计划也因此应运而生。在一以贯之的技术目标引领下，10年后的天问一号终于冲出地月系的束缚，开启了深空探测之路。由此可见，一以贯之的目标是拨开困难迷雾的航向标。在层层困难前，唯有坚定的目标才能使突围成功。\n\n突围的路途难免曲折，一以贯之的信念是必要的。C919客机背后的一位“大国工匠”，胡双钱，三十多年来坚守让祖国飞机翱翔蓝天的信念，做到了上千万个零件无差错的奇迹，既让一位技工的事业实现了“突围”，也让国家在航空领域成功“突围”，走向国产化；宁允展，一位坚信产品质量必须完美才能履行工人职责、二十余年专攻列车转向架并做到十年无次品的工人，为CRH380A型高铁能驰骋祖国大地做出了至关重要的贡献。试想，如果这些“大国工匠”心中没有数十年坚持力求产品完美的信念和凭借自身工作满足国家和人民期待的觉悟，国家的发展又如何推进？正因为他们有如此的信念，而且从未改变，这些奇迹才能成真。\n\n突围总需要挑战极限，一以贯之的坚持是必然的。突围本身就是挑战困难与极限的过程，怎能瞬间而成？为突破大气层的束缚，人类自1903年液体火箭雏形提出后通过六十年的创新，才使第一位宇航员升空；人类基因测序从1990年开始，历经三十余年的探索，历经数次生物技术极限的突破，在2022年终获成果……极限是在曾经一次次尝试中设下的，因此只有坚持尝试才能将极限破除。\n\n突围之路上，除了怀揣突围的能力，更需要的是一以贯之的精神：一以贯之的目标、信念和坚持。只有一以贯之，才能使破除困境的能力得到真正体现，从而突围。\n\n# 弄潮\n弄潮，即“踏浪翻波”，意为在水中搏击、嬉戏。但它有着更深层次的意义，这也是今年来这个词语高频率出现的原因之一。\n\n弄潮，势必要在风险困难中拼搏。但若是成功消除了面前的“巨浪”，自身体魄定会加强，眼前所见乃全新的景色。由此观之，获得超越和进步，是弄潮的意义所在。\n\n个人的弄潮，促进个人理想的实现，带来人生境界的提升。风险重重的基建事业中，涌现出一个个弄潮者：顾延安，冒着沉管隧道破裂的风险亲自检查港珠澳大桥的隧道；宁允展，顶着一丝误差即引起高铁脱轨的危险在十年间专造转向架……无数的大国工匠们与各自的风浪搏斗着，成为一个个不计回报的弄潮儿。除了实现使本职工作臻于完美的理想以外，他们更成就了国家的发展，将个人与国家民族命运相关联，人生的意义得到升华。\n\n社会的弄潮，促进多方合力的形成，带来社会面貌的巨变。中国举办各种赛事的历史，就是最好的体现：中国第一次亚运会，加快了包括北京在内众多城市的建设；中国第一次奥运会，革新了中国在新世纪的面貌……之所以仅仅一次盛会就能产生如此强大的力量，是因为人们鼎力支持，人人愿做“弄潮儿”，冒着组织上抑或是技术上的风险投身于赛事的幕后工作中，才形成了强大的、全国范围的合力。\n\n国家的弄潮，决定“弄潮”的汇聚，带来步入新时代的突破。中国历史上，在面临危机关头时，不同时代的历史走向截然不同：宋朝后期，面临少数民族铁骑南下，朝廷一味求和，致使政权覆灭；新中国成立以来，在面对经济困难还是开拓新路的尝试中，国家总能成功突围。宋朝的覆灭，原因离不开国家并没有弄潮的意愿，自然无法凝聚全国上下的斗志，纵使有仁人志士挺身而出也最终无济于事；现在国家能取得如此成就，正是因为国家敢于挑战风浪，肩挑重担，尤其是在世界经历百年未有之大变局，国际关系风险横生的时代。国家是远比社会庞大的集体，唯有国家下定弄潮的决心，个人与社会的弄潮才能显示其力量，汇聚成推动历史的动力。\n\n个人、社会和国家的弄潮彼此相互依存，在超越现状与获得进步的道路上进步缺一不可。作为新时代的青年，我们需要意识到弄潮的进步作用，与风险搏斗，才能破除困境，走向新的境界。\n\n# 我读《红楼梦》之*谜语人一般的行文风格*\n《红楼梦》一书之所以能跨越三个世纪的光阴而依旧被人们所熟知，其“梦”一般的文字功不可没。各种谐音、暗示和伏笔等贯穿全书，使得《红楼梦》如同神话一样，现实中对于贾府形形色色人物的描写、他们各自被预示的未来，乃至仙境中的隐秘之事水乳交融。《红楼梦》中有如此多的“谜语”和暗示，主要是因为曹雪芹使用了“隐”的写作方法。\n\n对于“隐”，我们可以先简单归类一下。“隐”在书中的使用以谐音、典故和“离奇”情节为主要方式：谐音有如“甄士隐”“贾雨村”“英莲”等人名的谐音；典故有书中人物点的戏剧，阅读的书籍等；“离奇”情节主要指书中描写“仙境”的情节，如全部第一回和第五回中贾宝玉梦游太虚幻境。从种类颇多的“隐”来看，《红楼梦》被称作“四大名著”之首和曹雪芹以一本书就明冠天下都是自然而然的。关于“隐”的作用，大致有四点，在下文展开。\n\n“隐”预示未来\n不可不说，这是“隐”最明显的作用了。关于这种作用，最典型的代表是第五回中金陵十二钗的判词和判曲了。尽管它们确实是来自曹雪芹的剧透，但这种朦朦胧胧的未知感也胜过你不知好歹的损友滔滔不绝的剧透。判词和判曲中，尤其悲凉和易懂的是最后一首——〔首尾·飞鸟各投林〕。“投林”让人直接联想到“树倒猢狲散”，进而领悟到这实际上是贾府的结局——贾氏家族最后将彻底崩溃。当然，当时在太虚幻境里梦游的贾宝玉肯定想不到这是他们家族的未来，但读者们会带着这个冥冥中早已确定的结局阅读下去。在看着贾府中一个个人物登台退场时，读者难免心生悲哀和无奈之感——因为读者们知道无论故事如何发展贾府都是消亡的结局。所以，预示未来的“隐”可以带给读者更深刻的阅读时情感体验。\n“隐”去的内容提高全书艺术价值\n这里的“艺术价值”，既指文字的美感，又指文字体现的精神思想。\n\n从文字的角度，“隐”的部分常以诗词的方式登场。这一点和许多中国古代小说一样，只要遇到人物登场或者事件发生就必有“端的只见：”和占满一页的诗。曹雪芹与众不同的是他将书中众人的结局通过谐音和拆字等方法融入到诗中，形成了判词和判曲，达到了虚实结合的效果。在第十七回中，曹雪芹写众人游大观园时也安排他们在各个景致前留下了诗歌、对联等，在渲染大观园别出心裁的设计时展现诗词和对联文化的魅力。曹雪芹还为林黛玉等人设计了“海棠诗社”，对于塑造才女形象的作用自然不必赘述。\n\n从精神角度看，“隐”展现了作者的精神追求。第一回的目的几乎就是这点，我们也能从中大篇幅的“隐”窥见。“甄士隐”和“贾雨村”暗含“真假”和“存隐”，这来自一些中国古代乃至印度佛教的理念，但由于我觉悟不够所以省略具体诠释。跛足道人的《好了歌》更加体现了曹雪芹对于功名的态度：人们建功立业、发财致富、贪恋妻妾、顾念儿孙都是被情欲蒙蔽，不可取。而这也是全书的核心之一，由此我们也可以得出“隐”的另一个含义……\n\n“隐”展现作者的倒影\n文学家写书，多多少少都会在书中影射自己。而在《红楼梦》中，整部书都是在“真事隐”的前提下展开的，“真事”指的什么自然不言而喻——是曹雪芹家道中落前的生活。身为江南织造之家的公子，他在江南享受了荣华富贵，甚至乾隆皇帝南巡都在他们府中落脚。从一方面来说，这些上流社会的生活时曹雪芹接触了大量的知识，他出神入化的服饰描写就可以证明。另一方面，他也见识了上流社会的腐朽，在被抄家后他于是反思这一切的开端，于是就有了警醒世人的《红楼梦》。从某种程度上说，《红楼梦》中贾府正是曹府。\n\n总之\n“隐”成就了《红楼梦》，为读者展开了一个与书平行的世界，使曹雪芹自己的倒影荡漾在读者的脑海中。\n\n# Comments on \"Fence or ambulance\"\nDespite the fact that this classical poem was written approximately 130 years ago, the discussion of whether construct a fence or assemble a fleet of ambulances down in that hypothetical valley continued to this day. As a part of the content itself, people’s opinions towards the two options were mentioned: some of them were advocates of the ambulance, as it seemed straightforward enough to those people; some, however, believed the fence is better as it prevented any further tragedies.\n\nIn my point of view, same with the author, a fence is certainly better than an ambulance. It can be explained through multiple aspects, and I’m in favor of these two: cost and effect.\n\nIn terms of cost, the fence is certainly a lot cheaper in different ways. Though ambulances are indeed flexible, it is widely acknowledged that operating them requires a fortune: not just the cost of vehicles, but also expenses of medical instruments as well as labor cost should be added. For the fence, it only requires the initial installation cost and regular maintenance. Nevertheless, both plans are capable of saving lives, yet at different costs, and it is apparent to judge which is more economic. In our school lives, time is what matters the most, and time cost of different learning styles is visible. Going through different subjects altogether at the end of the month require several days and even a whole week, yet completing revision tasks daily only takes minutes. I’m uncertain about others’ choices, but I’m going to build my “fence” day by day.\n\nReferring to effect, the fence reaches a far more realistic outcome. Ambulances evidently rescue people that are already in danger, and dying in some cases might be inevitable, as it takes time for the ambulance to arrive, which means they cannot save all lives or have a better result. On the other hand, fences prevent people from standing close to the cliff, thus nobody would fall. Surly the fence can save all lives quickly and with no further matters to worry. Similar in our lives, stopping the cause of problems is a lot convenient than repairing consequences. It is always a better option to improve our studies by going through textbooks and mistakes daily than do a lot of exercises after countless mistakes. The first way can stop most problems in the future, yet the latter only tackles with the current situation.\n\nTo sum up, the fence option is more appealing than ambulances, as it can reach a better outcome with relatively little effort. Having said that, it is still uneasy to build a fence of your own, owing to the fact that fences require the persistence of yourself. Nevertheless, fences stand out.\n\n\n\n\n","tags":["原创","Ameitsu Orchestra","水水水"],"categories":["Ameitsu Orchestra"]},{"title":"at STY

\"额……没人告诉我有商务座位\")\n19号线起步时加速度极大，真是个演示牛顿第二定律的好东西。而且19号线列车是100%自动的，连驾驶室都没了，只有一个被锁上了的仪表盘。\n\n话嗦回来，我专门体验它干嘛（四声）啊？是酱紫的：\n> STY的总部位于○运村附近，而南站在丰台边上。正常人的思维是先坐14号线到蒲○榆，再换乘5号线纵穿整个■京市区。\n\n>但STY不是正常人。我发现假如坐14号线往西一站到景○门，再换乘19号线一直坐到终点站牡○园，接着乘坐10号线到惠新○○南口，最后坐5号线，就能少停靠5个站点！\n\n>真的我没开玩笑，你康嘛：正常人方案是**北京南站-永定门外-景泰-蒲黄榆-天坛东门-磁器口-崇文门-东单-灯市口-东四-张自忠路-北新桥-雍和宫-和北-和西-惠南-惠北**，共17站；STY脑子不正常方案是**北京南站-景风门-牛街-太平桥-积水潭-北太平庄-牡丹园-健德门-北土城-安贞门-惠南-惠北**，共12站。\n\n>实验结果：考虑所有等车和换乘时间，不正常方案成功节省了**3分钟**，好耶(◕‿◕)！！！！！\n\n这说明什么？这说明大站快车是多么重要啊！伦敦安排上了国铁级别的伊丽莎白线来分担中央线压力，○京有必要整一个类似的。~~（定名“老佛爷线”）~~\n{%raw%}\n<hr>\n{%endraw%}\n\n返校之后，有一个总结大会，我们也听到了不少挺有意思的事儿，比如有人悄悄从酒店的地下逃生通道跑到了相邻的同公司的另一座酒店，被抓获的时候正在点餐。\n还有就是我们认为的重头戏——年级视频。只是它根本打不开，幸亏负责人跑回楼硬生生把班级电脑上的播放软件拷了回来，这才完事儿。很hardcore属于是。\n# 社团开始了\nSTY参加的是计算机社团。别看微信群里有十六七个人，实际上到场的只有六七个人。\n\n计算机社团对标的是竞赛，所以第一次活动时候我就发现这个地方可能有点让我水土不服。竞赛要求用`C++`，但我会的语言里没一个叫这个，Python真爱粉了属于是。其次，纵览我做过的东西（ChemCal© IfoCon© AmeitsuRailwayMap©）,不难看出我是一个喜欢实际应用和乐子的人。没事，未来可期口牙！\n\n\n# “趣味运动会”\n几周之后，面对生草而吵闹的操场，STY会想起体育老师保证说有个运动会的那个遥远的下午。上次的正经运动会还是小学捏，甚至还是在奥体中心开的，排面拉满。而这次的趣味运动会其实也在意料之中——距离期中就半个月了。\n\n趣味运动会的草台班子气息是人尽皆知的，就比如说到比赛前一天我们才想起来都报了什么项目，甚至只练了几回。而且，由于我们班的各位朋友有点害羞，报名表根本写不满，但是硬性指标还在，所以班主任就随便安排人补上缺口了。\n\n下面由STY锐评一下部分项目：\n- **跳大~~神~~绳**：本来以为是八字儿，实际上是一堆人同时跳那种。保证一次就断，连不起来。不过驽马十驾功在不舍，最后我班运动健儿成功取得了**3分钟42个**的好成绩🎉\n- **螃蟹跑**：描述一下：摆出篮球中滑步的姿势，然后在你身上从上往下套一个呼啦圈，呼啦圈刚好被腿支撑住；跑的时候侧着身跑，不能让呼啦圈掉下来。本年级战绩为**干碎4个呼啦圈**🎉\n- **珠行万里**：十个人拿十个凹槽，有一个球在凹槽拼接出的轨道中滚，后面的人要赶紧把自己的凹槽往前面接，最后让球滚进一个看着像坩埚的东西里。为什么不能直接端着球过去捏？\n- **托乒乓球**：拿个球拍，托着乒乓球走到对面。这个项目的关键在于接触面粗糙程度要足够大。另外，这是我校传统项目。\n\n我们班整了个**第一**，虽然但是一共只有8个班。而且，第一的奖杯上既没有写什么项目，也没有我们班班号，只有校名和“团体第一名”。可见这玩意大概率传了好几代，跟大力神杯一样风水轮流转。\n# 嗑盐\nSTY被拉着入伙了一个准备科研活动的组里面。最开始定的选题是**探究蟑螂药浓度对蟑螂死亡率的影响**，但这玩意简直是养蛊：每次蟑螂药的浓度都提高，每一轮都能选拔出蟑螂王，我都无法想象六七次以后出来的的是什么玩意儿。接着又说了一个**探究大蒜素对大肠杆菌的杀菌效果的影响**，但是——\n\nSTY至今虽然在场做了实验的一部分，但是**根本不知道**实验的完整操作，现在连**数据都没有**，**图表**也画不成，结论硬编也**够呛**。而且实验的照片和视频什么的**害得拿光盘**交，STY手里也没有光盘刻录的设备。最重要的是——好像是**后天**（2023.11.13）**就收**！希望人没事🙏\n:::success\nSTY利用近十年的收拾烂摊子技术有惊无险地做完了，\\\\(\\^o^)/\n:::\n\n:::success\nohhhhhhhhhhh咱评上三等奖啦（update:2024-1-4

出发！\n如线路图所示，列车在21:59分离开了北京丰台——就不能把时间改成22:00吗？火车消失在丰台西南的月色中，沿京九线南下，不久就进入了河北省。\n![_20231013222104_1.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/10/13/_20231013222104_1.jpg \"虽然但是，这是衡水\")\n同包间的舍友想到火车要经过黄河，所以STY大致根据地图上了一个凌晨2:00的闹铃来轰我们起床。\n\nSTY被分到了实践活动总结视频的制作组，而我们在去程上就开工了。STY虽然被指定成负责人，但由于携带的设备太拉跨了，只有一部某品牌的**青春版手机**，而其他人有云台和单反，所以没法产出太多能用的素材，只能退居二线来整理分类所有素材并给点意见。\n\n在熄灯后STY等人的电脑同时启动的场景是炸裂的，尤其是好像只有我们几个带电脑。不过，STY根本没处理什么素材或者剪辑，而是修U盘。具体来说，STY的U盘有Type-3接口，所以能很轻松地从手机上复制媒体文件。但是，有一个文件操作岔劈了，导致根本没写入，是一个幽灵文件。在第二次将U盘插入手机时手机她不认了。这个幽灵文件最神奇的是无法移动且无法删除。STY发现这个幽灵文件可以用VS Code打开，所以采取了随便写入一点字符或者硬改扩展名的方式来处理——然并卵这个文件还在。\n\n临近23:00时STY终于能躺一下——其实⑧行。走廊里怎么一堆熬通宵的啊！！！吵死。\n\n在2:00时，手机闹铃久违地准时响了。然后——火车刚刚越过黄河进入河南。真的，但凡我把预计到黄河大桥的运行时间少约一位也不至于。\n\n# 吃个早饭吧，骚年！\n从23:00到5:00，每隔一个小时就有一个人在包间口大声密谋。\n\n5:50，STY实在扛不住了，赶紧面对新的一天吧。\n\n早饭带的是汤○人豚骨拉面方便面。考虑到在包间里吃这个**扣功德**，所以STY觉得去餐车吃更好。唯一的问题是STY在一车厢，而餐车很明显是七车厢……没事，长途跋涉！\n\nSTY抄起方便面和除了茉莉花茶味东方茶叶以外的其他战略物资向七车厢走去。\n\n![_20231013222104_2.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/10/13/_20231013222104_2.jpg)\n\n吃方便面有很多种心碎时刻，比如说少调料包，叉子断了……以及**忘了把调料包拿出来**！STY以为这种东西不可能给什么肉的，直到STY在水浴加热（确信）泡面三分钟后在碗底发现了小小的一块还在塑料包中的肉肉……\n\n火车的餐车不只是一个担心因在包间吃泡面而被扣功德的人的避难所，它本身就是一个餐厅。让我们看看餐车都卖点啥……\n![_20231013222103_1.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/10/13/_20231013222103_1.jpg)\n- **蛋炒饭套餐**：一碗蛋炒饭，外加四个小菜：花生一碟，难以辨认的俩咸菜共一碟，鸡蛋一个。有一说一，这是STY头一次知道鸡蛋算小菜。\n- **小米粥套餐**：一碗小米粥，但工作人员待会儿又说是稀饭，加上刚才提到的四种小菜。\n\n总的来说：**都比学校的好吃**。我校以成绩优异和伙食忧抑闻名■■区。\n\n火车在江北的土地上颤抖着，在水田的喘息和阴云的吟哦中穿过了一座座无名的小站，从更高、更灰暗、更粗壮的高架桥下穿梭过去。这看起来是多么的赛博朋克，但请注意——本站站名和cyberpunk一点关系没有。\n![_20231013222102.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/10/13/_20231013222102.jpg)\n#

衣：以校服为主，睡衣要自带————当然各个寝室都有穿校服睡觉的蛹者；校服脏了宿管会给你洗（是的仅限校服），内衣袜子就要劳烦诸位亲自动手了。\nPs.九万里是每天都会洗澡的那种人，此前一直以为所有女生都是香香软软头发有香味的那种，并认为自己狂放不羁的酚酞形象是认知定义域内雌性人类的底线——直到九哥发现寝室里有漂亮妹子可以一周不换内衣、不洗澡时：\n“这就是个骗局！！！香香软软的漂亮妹纸都是假的呜呜呜呜呜——”\n![1694255516202.png](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/09/09/1694255516202.png)\n- 食：早饭6:35  粥汤类二选一+鸡蛋+咸菜+一个面食; 晚饭17:25 汤+学校午饭同款+橘子+牛奶\n总体不错，吃的是上一顿教室食堂做多了剩的饭菜——有一天甚至给了烤翅、麻辣烫和苹果。话说，橘子中的果酸应是会与牛奶中的蛋白质变性凝结，刺激肠粘膜引起腹痛腹泻的罢......\n!!（我是肠胃不好第一人，周一的牛奶喝完吐到怀疑人生——从此熟悉凌晨一点的学校厕所）!! 从此我便发誓远离学校牛奶。\n\n- 住：起初寝室里大家都很拘谨，换衣服都要到厕所里换......然鹅，这一切都在洗过一次澡后改变了——我洗澡是那种三分钟结束战斗的人，并没有目睹现场——但是据说发生了一场坦诚相见的嬉水活动（大概罢）。从此寝室里的气氛发生了一些微妙的变化。本来素不相识的女孩纸们之间形成了一种略显诡异的熟悉，风气也变得开放起来：甚至有人在宿舍里几乎裸奔。\n“反正康都康过了，已经无所谓啦。”——那位妹纸如是说道。\n\n!!.....苍天啊！！！只有我九万里，清清白白的九万里......！！！———是橘外人。!!\n\n本周住宿人数：14/16  退宿两人（有一位据说是肠胃受不了，总之我换去了她的床位）\n\n>其险也如此，嗟尔远道之人胡为乎来哉!\n\n:::default\nSTY曰：这位JK自称是女变态，所以不要信她说的话。有女孩纸裸奔这件事已经外传了，有望在三年后成为我校的又一个校园传说。\n:::\n","tags":["高中牲STY-番外","非原创"],"categories":["醉眠秋共被"]},{"title":"Notorial

用于打造交互式命令行。本系列主要参考它的[官方文档](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)。\n# 下载PT\n可以用`pip`或者`anaconda`。但是STY主要使用前者。\n~~~python\npip install prompt_toolkit\n~~~\n# 打印普通文本\n~~~python\nfrom prompt_toolkit import print_formatted_text\n\nprint_formatted_text('Hello world')\n~~~\n![1.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/09/08/1.jpg)\n`print_formatted_text()`可以用来打印普通文本。如果想以假乱真，可以酱紫：\n~~~python\nfrom prompt_toolkit import print_formatted_text as print\n\nprint('Hello world')\n~~~\n# 打印格式化文本\n打印格式化文本需要这三种方法之一：创建HTML对象、创建ANSI对象、创建`(样式,文本)`元组或使用`pygments`库。STY主要使用HTML，毕竟已经学过了。\n~~~python\nfrom prompt_toolkit import print_formatted_text, HTML\n\nprint_formatted_text(HTML('<b>This is bold</b>'))\nprint_formatted_text(HTML('<i>This is italic</i>'))\nprint_formatted_text(HTML('<u>This is underlined</u>'))\n~~~\n![2.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/09/08/2.jpg)\n:::warning\n实际上，这里的`<i></i>`标签没有被渲染成斜体，现在这大概率是个未解之谜。\n:::\n使用HTML对象时，需要先import到程序中。这样一来，就可以直接使用HTML标签了。\n~~~python\nprint_formatted_text(HTML('<skyblue>This is sky blue</skyblue>'))\nprint_formatted_text(HTML('<seagreen>This is sea green</seagreen>'))\nprint_formatted_text(HTML('<violet>This is violet</violet>'))\n~~~\n![3.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/09/08/3.jpg)\n也可以用颜色标签设置背景色。\n为了更好编辑格式信息，可以将格式内容在一个字典中编写：\n~~~python\nfrom prompt_toolkit import print_formatted_text, HTML\nfrom prompt_toolkit.styles import Style\n\nstyle = Style.from_dict({\n    'aaa': '#ff0066',\n    'bbb': '#44ff00 italic',\n})\n\nprint_formatted_text(HTML('<aaa>Hello</aaa> <bbb>world</bbb>!'), style=style)\n~~~\n![4.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/09/08/4.jpg)\n:::info\n在上一个实例中，像`<aaa></aaa>`的标签是自定义的。在PT中，可以使用自定义的标签，前提是和样式字典匹配。\n:::\n~~~python\nfrom prompt_toolkit import print_formatted_text\nfrom prompt_toolkit.formatted_text import FormattedText\n\ntext = FormattedText([\n    ('#ff0066', 'Hello'),\n    ('', ' '),\n    ('#44ff00 italic', 'World'),\n])\n\nprint_formatted_text(text)\n~~~\n\n和HTML很像的方法是样式元组。此方法的大致内容与HTML对象类似，不再赘述。\n\n一个有用的函数是`to_formatted_text()`。它可以使输入符合格式化文本的要求：\n~~~python\nfrom prompt_toolkit.formatted_text import to_formatted_text, HTML\nfrom prompt_toolkit import print_formatted_text\n\nhtml = HTML('<aaa>Hello</aaa> <bbb>world</bbb>!')\ntext = to_formatted_text(html, style='class:my_html bg:#00ff00

STY会入手那个`.online`域名吗？\n- 答曰：**会**。但是不太可能在高一。主要的原因是目前的域名服务提供商要求用户实名制，还只支持支付宝上的实名制小程序，而我只有因为微信零钱而开通的微信支付。\n\n4. about页记录的STY相关介绍是烟雾弹吗？\n- 答曰：**否**。除了名字等敏感信息未公开外，那个页面上的内容100%属实，包括xp。\n\n5. 本站文章如果含有过多报废图片链接，会删除吗？\n- 答曰：**否**。对于符合[at STY vol.11|历史的枢纽互通式立体交叉](https://ameitsu.github.io/uncategorized/at_STY/%25E5%258E%2586%25E5%258F%25B2%25E7%259A%2584%25E6%259E%25A2%25E7%25BA%25BD%25E4%25BA%2592%25E9%2580%259A%25E5%25BC%258F%25E7%25AB%258B%25E4%25BD%2593%25E4%25BA%25A4%25E5%258F%2589/)中栏目说明（已同步至about页）的投稿，STY会依据本地文件夹记录和上下文补充图片。\n\n6. 旧AC的结局是怎样的？\n- 答曰：**完整保存**，但不会更新或重新部署。\n\n# @STY\n1. 本栏目到底叫什么名字？\n- 答曰：**正式的标题为 “@STY”**，但为了避免出现特殊字符或转义不当导致生成错误，在文件名（同时是大标题）中将“@”转写为“at”\n\n2. @STY系列为什么缺少 vol.8 和 vol.9？\n- 答曰：**有被删除的页面**。在暑假开始前，本系列只有9个页面。在AC迁移计划开始后，本系列的 vol.2 和 vol.3 因与学习生活无关和质量低的原因在旧AC被删除，vol.4-9向前顺位补充空缺编号。迁移工作进行中，为不影响新站施工，新页面都是在旧AC中编辑的，而按旧AC顺序新写的两篇应为 vol.10 和 vol11。新写的两篇在同步到新AC时未考虑编号问题，所以在新AC中，vol.7后面直接是vol.10。\n\n3. 在vol.1中，STY真的占到小便宜了吗？\n>还有我的电脑比旁边的慢一会儿，所以我在别人作答快结束了才能答题，含泪占了小便宜 233\n- 答曰：**否**。当时耳机隔音效果和自己家墙一样滴水不漏，事实上听不清旁边同学作答的清晰声音，只能根据发音的相似性姑且判断自己的答案和其他人一不一样。\n\n4. vol.2中“梦开始的地方”到底指什么？\n- 答曰：**没想好**。但是有以下几种备选的解释：其一，指这是最初的“唠嗑系列”第一篇；其二，指初三三次大考的开始；其三，STY走的是直升路线，第一次直升考试自然可以被称作有“梦开始的地方”。\n\n5. vol.2中这一段表述是否为意淫？\n>我就是那种发成绩了才有女孩纸来问成绩来排名的小透明\n- 答曰：**否**。事实上，这是有实际案例的。有一名我无法提供姓名的女生和我的一年来唯一一条微信聊天记录就是问分的。\n\n6. vol.2中这一段幸灾乐祸环节是否属实？\n> 据考试后隔壁考场的我一个缺德朋友表示被传成我初恋的我小学同桌错了最后一个多选，喜大普奔希望她没事。\n- 答曰：**疑为假**。首先，这个消息是“缺德朋友”给的，有一定虚构的可能性。其次，据中考结束，也就是近4个月后我才知道她没有参加直升考试。但由于消息人士的说法含糊不清，我无法确定她是完全没参加直升考试还是没有参加第二次直升考试。不过，中考时候她坐我前面(´｡• ᵕ •｡`)\n\n7. 所以你STY和她什么关系？\n- 答曰：**同学关系**。就是普普通通的同学关系嘛，谁都有可能和女同学一起坐啊。才，才没有什么特别的关系呢，哼( 〃▽〃)\n![1693305444383.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/29/64edcaa694c53.jpg \"如果你和STY聊这个，STY的表情和眼神会是这样（刻意避开说话人的目光，嘴唇轻轻上扬，脸红）\")\n8. vol.3中那个黑板真的那么难擦干净吗？\n- 答曰：**是**。最后战绩为15分钟以后才完全干净。\n\n9. 朝阳区的一模卷子真的比海淀区的难吗？\n- 答曰：**是**。可以找找各位老师的评价。\n\n10. 有人加入浅野千华二创吗？\n- 答曰：**真有**。有一个男性朋友说他肯定加入，还要拉上另一个对共笔作品感兴趣的女同学加入。最后只有他和我合作了，一起把浅野物语的正史设定完成了。\n\n11. vol.4最后的琐记的内容完全没有交代后续。\n- 答曰：**行，我在这里续写一下**。\n本来想着直升名单会很快出来，结果5月13日上午我们班主任一个电话就打到我妈咪那里了。真的那是我毕业之前听见我们班主任说过的最后一句话。\n那个经常催更的热心读者和STY一起直升本校高中了。可见催更在未来的三年里躲不掉(︶︹︺)\n不算子至今依然没有修好。不过也不用了，新AC里不会有访问次数统计。\nSTY收集的签名大概率散佚了。经过暑假期间三四回大扫除依然没有发现它的踪影。\n最后，STY也没有跳书记舞。\n那个给物理老师翻译的视频最后派上用场了，可以说是很令人欣慰。\n另外，在拿到毕业照后我发现我是全校最黑的 ヽ(`⌒´メ)ノ\n\n12. vol.5里曾说高中部的那块黑板上的东西有点抽象。具体是怎样的？\n- 答曰：**我回忆一下**。首先有很多键政的内容，STY略过不说。剩下的基本上是宅文化的东西，但主要是原神（到处都是我滴妈）。还有冷门一点的，比如某个过几天（当前日期2023.8.29）要过16岁生日的虚拟歌姬。黑板背后的白板上有一个她的涂鸦、《千本樱》副歌歌词和《呐呐呐》主歌前几行。对了，后面那两个都是STY写上去的。( ◡‿◡ *)\n![1693305338751.jpeg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/29/64edcaa4b9d2a.jpeg)\n除此以外还有正常的表白和揭短环节，也是我们高中生喜闻乐见的。\n\n13. 新AC的语言选项真的有问题吗？\n- 答曰：**没有问题**。Hexo根目录的config文件支持的简体中文是`zh-CN`，但Shoka主题的简体中文是`zh_CN`，所以渲染的时候语言选项理论上渲染器看⑧懂。\n\n14. vol.6里这个情节属实吗？\n>其实当天上午 STY 就戴上了那个狐狸耳朵，然后楼道里的几位过路同学都表示十分震撼。STY 在卫生间里都被拍了，还使某位持相机的女性盆友被当成变态。\n- 答曰:**完全属实**。那位女同学拍的照片流出后在我们班被做成meme了。\n\n15. STY真的张贴百合宣传资料了吗？\n- 答曰：**是真的**。由此还炸出了7个百合控。\n\n16. STY在vol.6里声明过自己的身份。这是不是此地无银三百两？\n- 答曰：**不是，这里纯属玩梗**。这些都出自同学的真实评价。\n\n# SofTY\n1. 本系列为什么叫这个名字？\n- 答曰：**凑出STY三个大写字母**。但是后来我想到了一个合理的解释：**S**oftware-related content **of** S**TY**。\n\n2. 代综计算器的结局如何？\n- 答曰：**鸽了**。\n\n3. SofTY vol.4到底哪里去了？\n- 答曰：**很快能重启**。目前的选题有“离子方程式计算器”“系列图片下载器”“三角函数训练程序”这三个。但是不可能最近写完。\n\n# 游记\n:::info\n等到问题多了再来添加\n:::\n# Ameitsu

军训！\n对于每个准JK/DK，军训总是命中注定的。\n![1693211988939.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/28/64ec5d803bd1b.jpg)\n理论上新冠肺炎疫情都虎头蛇尾地结束了，军训被恢复是理所应当的事情。确实，只不过今年的军训因为一点小问题而改了改形式，原因请见[这一篇的最后](https://ameitsu.github.io/uncategorized/at_STY/%E8%BF%99%E6%9A%91%E5%81%87%E5%A4%AA%E7%97%9B%E4%BA%86/)。\n![rain](https://k.sinaimg.cn/n/spider20230731/200/w1080h720/20230731/b81c-581ec814aa7c03b22d6cf346c8bc0114.jpg/w700d1q75cms.jpg?by=cms_fixed_width)\n谁能想到当时我写的“细水长流”的暴雨最后经确定是北京**400**年以来最大的降水！受灾最严重的自然是山区，比如昌平，房山，门头沟这些地方。而山区往往意味着**军训基地**！此时的军训基地估计也都被水淹了。但是考虑到洪水消退后沉积物可能会引发疫情或者其他令人不悦的事情，所以军训基地基本没有开放，而我们只能到学校去训练了。\n:::warning\n鉴于军训的内容势必要涉及学校的各种资料，所以以下内容尽可能避免图片出现，如果有也会打码。\n::::\n##

后续\n我在开学前就被指定成了班长，于是在军训后就接了班主任的活儿，要做一个军训视频。当然了，这个视频肯定不会公开。因为这个视频中我选的BGM是《孤独摇滚》的OP，还因为调效果反反复复听了十几遍，后面一段时间内我不想听见~~勃起~~波奇酱她们唱歌。\n\n还有学校的蚊子真多，已经叮了十几个包了。\n![1693214661309.jpeg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/28/64ec6820c7b24.jpeg)\n# 关于本站的迁移改造计划\n从下面的powered by部分中，你可以看出目前的AC用的是shoka主题。之前的Next主题纯粹是过渡用的，并非STY最开始的计划。目前，新站的框架已经基本完成，新的模板文件已经完成上传，但还遗留了一些问题需要处理（最好在开学前处理掉，否则影响装X效果）。\n- 技术上\n    1. **之前在文中插入的超链接损坏**：新站的永久链接格式与旧站不一样，之前在文章中使用的本站链接需要更正。\n    2. **页面主题色尚未更改**：目前的颜色主题依旧是默认设定，只是STY手动更改了蓝色的深度。需要进一步定位使用颜色的设置项，并予以颜色种类上的更正。\n    3. **图片大量损坏**：这是本站第三次危机的余波。原来的图床把我的号删了，所以目前损坏的图片链接无法全部更换，必须通过本地文件夹和页面上下文推测应该修复哪些链接，并在新图床上上传对应的图片。\n    4. **缺头图**：虽然这个主题有随机图片的功能，但这个功能在某些设备上无法使用，所以需要手动添加自己的封面图。\n\n- 内容上\n\n    5. **有早期文章残留**：有些旧文章是黑历史，必须清除或补充更合适的内容。典型事例是原先的“建站宣言”被全新的about页代替。\n    6. **语气词过多**：去掉滥用的语气词可以显著提高本站的调调。\n    7. **挖坑过多**：在填上坑之前，应创建一个记录挖坑内容的文档\n    8. **空旷的下载区**：目前的下载区内容过少，甚至连音序都没填全。暑假期间STY自己制作了大量学习资料，也有一些好玩的内容，都比较适合添加到下载区。\n# 关于本站的运营方向调整\n高情商：运营方向调整\n低情商：要删东西啦~\n\n是的，考虑到STY已经进入高一，更新频率能比初三稍微提高一点，内容也会更有意思。但毕竟我是在上高中嘛！高中都在卷。所以实际上更新的精力不会很旺盛。所以，提前正式删掉一些栏目还是有必要的。\n:::warning\n切勿随意更改这部分！\n:::\n- 保留的栏目及内容说明\n    1. `SofTY`：编程，数理化内容，题目……\n    2. `@STY`：自己的学习生活\n    3. `Ameitsu Orchestra`：专栏文章\n    4. `游记`：目前“离谱游记”改名以后的栏目。\n- 撤销的栏目及删除理由\n    1. `冷门铁路史`：内容深度不够。但STY也很喜欢这个栏目（甚至还有一个坑还没填(´｡• ω •｡\\`)）\n    2. `Ameitsu Gametime`：其实每写一篇都要相应玩完游戏，制作周期过长，而且STY估计也不会有太多时间再玩了。\n    3. `学习资料`：没有单独投稿的必要，并入下载区。\n    4. `浅野千华合集`：无更新的精力和写二创的相应“技术”。但是我真的好喜欢那只猫娘😥。\n    5. `浅野物语`：世界观过大，难以落实。会将已有的内容生成PDF后放在下载区。\n    6. 插画系列（`百合插画` &`猫娘插画`）：没有单独投稿的必要，而且目前失效的图片链接几乎无法更换。STY所有下载过的Pixiv插画都会放在下载区，前提是Pixiv的用户协议和著作权说明允许这种行为。\n\n额外说明：本站需要一个 **“历史解释页面”** ，对二十余篇投稿中含糊的表述或者悬而未决的问题（例如浅野千华是否为那只被改造成服务器的半机械猫娘）进行明确的回答。\n\n:::success\n行了，后面的就随意吧。\n:::\n# 图床的变化\n原来使用的图床是[imgloc.com](https://imgloc.com/)。最初的三四个月它运行良好，而且没什么限制。直到本站[第二次危机](https://ameitsu.github.io/uncategorized/at_STY/%E6%BD%A6%E8%8D%89%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%8C%E6%A8%A1/)的发生。其实那次的影响不大，因为原图床似乎遇到了服务器宕机的问题，只返回`521`状态码。后来在[第三次危机](https://ameitsu.github.io/uncategorized/at_STY/%E8%BF%99%E6%9A%91%E5%81%87%E5%A4%AA%E7%97%9B%E4%BA%86/)中原图床彻底报废，因为我的账号直接被删了。目前的替代品是[cdnjson.com](https://cdnjson.com/)，应该比原先的更靠谱。无论如何，STY都应该减少图片数量，以避免版权或者未来的图床事故。\n\n来复习一下本站的危机编年史\n- 危机一：因为插件删除错误导致无法部署（2023.4）\n- 危机二：图床失效，但是最后基本解决（2023.5）\n- 危机三：图床彻底失效，虽然找到替代品但是善后工作不会容易（2023.6-7）\n- 危机四？：新AC的各种细节问题迟迟难以解决（2023.6-8）\n\n# 展望\nAC有了全新的about页，这规定了全站的核心目标；有了简化的内容主题，凝聚不多的更新精力；有了验证可靠的辅助资源，可以全面升级页面效果……总之，AC**在曲折的半年里向前进**！**AC的明天更美好**！谢谢大家。\n:::default\n嚯，这玩意早晚要入选耻辱柱页面\n:::\n就酱。\n![_20231127213638.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/11/28/_20231127213638.jpg)\n","tags":["at

**📚语文**\n作业第一项就是背诗。作业清单里说`熟读并背诵`，但显然语文老师会在分班考里来几个默写。放假前，老师说 **“就是背几首短诗哦”**，然后我看见了作业清单上白纸黑字的《琵琶行》《梦游天姥吟留别》《师说》《登泰山记》《赤壁赋》……(〃＞＿＜;〃)\n\n接下来是《论语》任务单。话说写简答题也没什么烦人的，毕竟道法老师都已经调教过初三学生的敏感度了，写几行也不是什么难题。但问题是任务单说\n>*请将划线词的含义和整句的意思写在空行中间*\n\n![1691761352027.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/1691761352027.jpg)\n行，真棒。于是STY抄了5页的《论语》注释和翻译😃超喜欢酱紫~ 手手已经要坏掉啦~ 请多来一点嘛喵呜~❤\n\n## **🧮数学 🔎物理 🧪化学**\n今年的数理化作业居然少的出奇！三科都留的是卷子，物理额外还有一个读书推荐抛瓦泼恩忒（Powerpoint）。\n\n卷子数量也在可接受范围以内（接受不了也没辙）。数学12页，物理14页，化学26页，其实任务量不大，甚至化学作业在放假之前就写完了 (◕‿◕)\n\n物理的抛瓦泼恩忒展现了STY水作业的高超技术。在只看了一章不到的情况下，我结合前言、后记和推荐词硬生生拼成了一个看起来高端大气上档次的玩意儿。说不定还能扔进下载区丢人现眼什么的 (⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)\n\n## **📜历史**\n核心的作业：5000字剧本！真的我都玉玉了，从来没见过真么震撼的任务。STY自己最高的文章字数记录是2981（中文）或2855（英文），真要硬凑5000还是有点小难度。(`ー´)\n\n但是这可是剧本啊！人物名字，动作这些的小零碎儿倒可以水挺多字数。(＠＾◡＾)\n\n这个破剧本估计以后能拿出来放下载区挨着物理抛瓦泼恩忒丢人现眼233 。\n\n## **📝道法**\n核心的作业：一个大任务，可以从读后感、设计中轴线文创、写模拟人大议案这些里挑。很明显最简单的就是读后感，因为在留作业前几天我就在班车上看完了某非著名人类社会学作品《枪炮，病菌和钢铁》，这不是想睡觉来枕头嘛！作业要求是800字，然后我写了大概2600左右，真的超级加倍。\n\n这个东西不用放在下载区丢人现眼啦，因为**早就丢过人了**！详见AO vol.3 ( 〃▽〃)\n\n## **📑英语**\n第一个害行，是默写点词儿，至今我们仍未知道那天老师到底让背多少。\n\n第二个，阅读任务。第一个是阅读外刊。我一看，哦！原来是Scientific American。几篇都还有点意思属于是，具体内容先不展开啦，等有水字数要求了再说。除此以外还要读一本叫《Flipped》的小说。这本小说~~讲的是门当户对的俩小孩因为一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事儿最后估计修成正果了的故事~~反正就是挺让STY对号入座的。(¬◡¬)✧\n\n第三个，配音。这种破作业我校学生从小学就开始水了，问题不大。但是有意思的是那个配音阿泼泼，里面居然还有英文版日漫，合着啥玩意儿都能变成英语配音是吧？直接上日语不好玩嘛？（算啦算啦，就当是体验欧美式日漫文化得了）\n\n第四个，练字（莫得选择，只能写衡水体）。衡水体成功做到了在规整中兼具参差不齐，在圆润中包含毛边……总之就是越看越奇怪。但是我斜体也写不好啊！只能写衡水体了……（πーπ）\n\n## **🌍地理**\n第一个活儿是观后感，要康自然地理纪录片。老师强烈建议我们看《地球的力量》，然鹅我想写那个逆天的《扯淡地球史》。但是吧，我要是真写《扯淡地球史》观后感的话那这文章只会比原作更逆天，毕竟《扯淡地球史》是以一语双关、故意读错名字、地狱笑话、肢体喜剧、把专家气得够呛为主要看点的。\n![1691761304288.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/1691761304288.jpg)\n下一个是自然地理新闻稿。我在7月15号晚上决定完成此项作业，不久我就康见了今年第四号台风的事情，于是我吃了个地球血馒头，蹭了个热度（没有吧我觉得）。老师要求是3分钟，于是我把朗读一遍精确到毫秒的时间直接注在文档里了，主打一个严谨。\n\n再然后就是自然景观图片配文。我从朋友圈里拍摄了一张荷花的照片（低情商：盗图），接着找了一个小暑的节气文案就完成辣！2023年的小暑是7月8日，刚好是放假第一天，挑这一天写可以充分体现我的主观能动性。(¯︶¯)\n\n## **😺生物**\n生物作业真的超精彩。老师留的主要作业就是那个观察任务，要嘛自己种一株植物，要嘛自己造一个水族箱。思前想后之下，我认为后者有一点小难度，主要是玻璃箱或者塑料箱的来源搞不定，况且还要砂石、消毒剂或者其他设备，最重要的是我**找不到鱼啊**！奥森里的太大，捞不到；去花鸟鱼虫市场买的也大概率活得没有厨房里小扑棱蛾子长。（我要是跟老师说河水里的浮游生物和水就是生态系统呢？）\n\n所以只能去种花。只有一个问题——作业要求这株植物必须能在假期内开花。我种的是太阳花，传说中它一个月就能开花。但为了安全起见，我同时买了种子和幼苗，目的就是让种子贡献发芽阶段的记录，与此同时幼苗的花也差不多能提供花朵生长的图片了，充分贯彻了中考数学18题的时间管理带师精神。\n\n可是这株小fafa一周半都莫得动静。不过已经不重要了，因为我发现有人在网上**卖太阳花观察记录**！￥9.9就能到手！本次作业的记录是以图画的形式，我本来以为在网上可以找到太阳花各生长阶段的图片来参考，然鹅似乎所有人只喜欢小fafa，所以这个￥9.9的图片包真的救了我啊！于是7月的一个没有阳光的夜晚里，我成功让小fafa的生长时间从一个多月快进到了一个多小时（指STY花一个半小时把全套记录画完了）\n![1691761330693.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/1691761330693.jpg)\n\n\n\n# 暑假为数不多的嗨皮事\n综上所述，这个暑假嗨不起来。\n\n正当STY看着朋友们进行去水立方玩水、去798转悠、去秦皇岛（疑似最后因天气原因在酒店里玩游戏）、逃离北京等的活动时，STY被迫在家肝作业以及复习分班考。但是这毕竟是中考完的暑假啊！怎么着得稍微嗨一下\n\n目前进行过的嗨皮事（也许能写点东西）\n- 尝试写一本gitbook\n- 完善了Ameitsu Cyberpark Nichome的配置\n- 发现了一个可靠的Google镜像\n- 找回了一个曾经一直使用的维基百科镜像\n- 编写了一个有关离子反应的python程序\n- 完善了一个从2022年启动至今的项目的GUI\n- 重温了《星球大战：克隆人战争》S1-S3\n- 三刷了《孤独摇滚》，同时利用某盗版动画网站练习了土法下载技术\n- (实际上不是暑假)在学校电脑上运行Live2D，并试图打开我做过的几个模型\n- （同样不算是暑假）以一己之力丰富了新高一朋友们的文化生活（能想象课间放V曲MV然后整个楼道的朋友们都来康吗）\n- ……\n\n\n# 本站第三次危机（2023/8/11解除）\n~~一言以蔽之：图床第二次挂了，爬了一下后返回的状态码为521，也就是说服务器不听使唤。所以说不是自己图床就千万不要完全信任。或者，来一个百分之百能保证不挂的图床~~\n\n\n没事儿了，已经找到了替代品。那个图床还说自己可稳定了，我暂且相信它一下。但是我发现用户协议里居然把动漫相关的东西当做违禁内容！可见本站的插画栏目搞不下去了……\n\n\n\n\n# 隆重介绍一下Static Download Page of Ameitsu Cyberpark©\n这就是以后的下载区！o(≧▽≦)o\n\n在接触不少python第三方库下载镜像站时，STY对这些镜像站简洁明了（简单粗暴）的设计感到十分着迷。这些镜像往往在`<body></body>`里先用`<h1></h1>`把标题打出来，然后就是无数个`<a

Germs and Steel）》读后感*\n\n<!--more-->\n不管是小学品德和社会课，还是初中的历史、道德与法治乃至地理学科，到高中的思想政治，我们或多或少都对人类如何从畏惧黑夜的直立生物变成占领全球的物种的过程有个基本的理解。但是很重要的一点是，我们在对这些历史的学习中，是将人类作为一个整体而言的，明显忽略了人类种群内部的差异性——社会的不同。而对于人类不同社会的理解，有一本书给了我极大的震撼，就是贾雷德·戴蒙得的作品《枪炮，钢铁和病菌》。\n\n首先，虽然我知道不能通过书名评价一本书，但不得不说这本书的标题是多么引人注目。英文原名Guns, Germs and Steel这三个毫无关系的词语直接点出了作者认为的人类社会中最具侵略性的力量，而且中文版由此采取的直译方式也十分惊艳，充分展现了作者对于人类社会的深刻认识。\n\n全书以一个问题串连起。但是这里选取的问题并非古希腊哲学家的思考抑或是某个学者的千古一问，而是1972年新几内亚岛上的政治人物亚力在碰巧遇到研究鸟类时的贾雷德时提出的疑问：“为什么白人制造出这么多货物，再运来这里？为什么我们黑人没搞出什么名堂？”\n\n确实，这个问题普遍存在，我们都清楚西欧和北美是发达国家聚集的地区，而亚洲非洲等地的经济情况在以上两个地域前显得寒酸。但作者不得不承认这是一个“看来简单，却难以回答”的问题，因为我们早已习惯于这一差距。25年后，贾雷德用这本书试图向读者解答亚力的疑问。\n\n对于亚力的疑问，答案看似是不同人种的优缺点，但是作者否决了这一观点。作为人类历史和人类社会活化石的一片天地，新几内亚岛让贾雷德见识了不少当地土著部落，就比如相互敌视的新几内亚高地人和低地人、彪悍的法玉人和被他们吓坏了的奇里奇里人。作者本身是美国人，对白人肯定有普遍的认知，再加上他多年来与新几内亚当地人的交流，他最后认为这些在“石器时代”生活的黑人的智力非但不会比“工业社会”中的白人逊色，甚至还可能强于他们。我们坚决反对种族歧视，而贾雷德正为此找到了有力的证据。\n\n那么为什么新几内亚岛上黑人和欧美的白人发展水平天差地别呢？我总结出作者认为其背后的原因是四类环境差异。\n\n第一类是自然资源方面的差异，主要体现在自然界中可驯化的动植物资源。很明显，这些资源越多，可供养的人口就越多。为论证此部分，作者通过植物学知识分析了大种子植物分布对人类分布的关系，通过对类似“肥沃新月”等早期农业区的分析介绍了动植物资源组成的“生物包（biological package）”对文明的产生的重要性。全书整个第二部分即为食物生产的兴起与扩散，相关的分析与资料的选取十分科学，尤其是作者通过一个个表格将通常情况下动辄几页纸的抽象论述总结出植物与人类发展的关联。而且，作者也提出稠密的人口会促进的病菌的演化，从而增强此地人群的抵抗力的观点。这是一个难以置信的结论，但事实正是如此，例如非洲中部的疟疾促使当地科洛桑人等部落进化出特殊造型的红细胞，从而减少疟原虫入侵的可能。由此可见，自然资源更加丰富的西欧文明得以迅速发展，而气候湿热、雨林环境恶劣的新几内亚岛的文明发展水平明显更低。\n\n第二类是气候和环境方面的差异，主要体现在影响农业传播的自然条件。欧亚大陆文明区的纬度差距不大，从中国到西欧以及返程上的农作物得以在两个地区正常生长，同时自然条件的不同也可以促进每一代植物的变异，丰富自然资源，作用于上一段中提到的第一类差异，促进欧亚大陆上文化的发展。从今天的视角我们也能验证这一观点：从东亚的中日韩三国，到西欧伊比利亚半岛，不论沿途的国家的经济发展水平如何，都融合了国际社会，同时国内的历史也能上溯至极远的年代。而新几内亚岛上的热带雨林气候难以使岛内的农作物资源相互交流，更不用说来自外界的作物了。所以，农业的快速传播是欧亚大陆得以快速发展的重要原因，而新几内亚岛文明发展落后也有一部分原因归于农业传播缓慢。\n\n第三类是影响技术洲际传播的因素，主要体现在地理差异。这里，作者介绍了“大陆轴线”的理论。为了解释大陆轴线的特点，以及大陆轴线如何影响了人类社会，我们需要来一点地理知识。地球绕太阳公转，同时自转。假如我们拿着地球仪模拟此过程，我们能清晰地看出一个事实：纬度相同的地区，不管经度如何变化，自然环境多少有相似之处，因为这些地区接受阳光的情况大致相同，只是时间不同；经度相同的地区只要纬度发生变化，自然环境就会发生极大的变化，因为这些地区接受阳光的情况不会一致。由此可见，如果大陆轴线沿着纬线南北展开，则轴线上的自然环节千差万别；而假如大陆轴线沿着纬线东西展开，则轴线上的自然环境总会有些相似之处。而适应了一个特定自然环境的人类自然在类似的环境中更轻松地跋涉，这也使东西展开的大陆轴线能让技术更快传播，而南北向的大陆轴线反而会阻碍技术传播。欧亚大陆的大陆轴线大致沿东西方向从中国直通伊比利亚半岛，而至于新几内亚所在的大洋洲甚至……没有明显的大陆轴线，导致技术传播向哪个方向都不甚容易。总之，以大陆轴线为主的地理差异延缓了新几内亚岛的文化发展。\n\n第四类是各大洲环境与创新水平的关系，体现在人口总数与大陆面积。关于人口因素，有一个简单的例子：欧亚大陆有发达国家日本，也有近几十年来追赶上的中国和韩国，这三个人口大国中涌现出了数不胜数的发明家与探索者，不管是哪个时代；而至于大洋洲群岛，每个群岛人口可能只有万余人，连人口总数都远少于东亚三国，自然这里诞生科学家的概率更低。对于中日韩的例子来说，更多的创新者会激发三国间的竞争，带来更多科技创新。至于大陆面积对于文化发展的影响，欧洲是更好的例子。欧洲从来没有统一过，而欧洲面积较小，土地资源有限，各个国家之间争夺资源，导致更多战争发生，同时战争催化科学进步，例如为军队研发武器时的伽利略研究出了自由落体理论。但这是建立在欧洲本身动植物资源丰富的基础上的，新几内亚岛本身的资源不足以使它在土地资源受限时反而建立辉煌的文明。\n\n在分析出这四个结论后，我感到自己对于“我们”的认知更加深入了。通过作者贾雷德的文笔，我意识到人类的一举一动都有自然的作用，不管是人类的产生、人类的迁移、人类文明的扩展乃至如今人类社会的未来。作为优秀的生物学家，贾雷德从环境的视角审视了1.3万年的岁月，尝试着为40多年前新几内亚岛上的政治家亚力解释人类社会的命运。尽管他也不完全支持所谓的“环境决定论”，但他通过贯通始终的分析框架，为我们展示了人类社会差异的一种解释。\n\n>“因此我很乐观，人类社会的历史可以当作科学来研究，就像研究恐龙一样。\n>我们的收获对当今的社会有益，\n>因为我们明白了什么塑造了现代世界，\n>什么又可能塑造我们的未来”\n>——《枪炮、病菌和钢铁》收场白\n\n\n","tags":["原创","Ameitsu

蓝色惑星的不羁搏动\n\n*——《地球的力量》观后感*\n\n\n\n说到地球的力量，2023年的人类最直观的感受就是极端天气频发与反常高温，在高温预警中北半球又战战兢兢地过着一个又一个难熬的夏日。现在，全球变暖的效果已经如此明显，21世纪10年代以来几乎每个半球的夏天里都会传出对应极点超过20-30摄氏度的新闻，崩塌的冰川也几乎无法挽回，而人类已经开始真正见证地球紊乱时的失控力量——温室气体浓度升高会影响整个生物圈。\n\n而在这个北京40多年来最热的一个夏天里，我观看了地理老师推荐的纪录片《地球的力量》，一部近16年前的经典作品。尽管片中部分数据和事实已经过时，但整部纪录片带来的对自然地理和地球的理解是更为可贵的。\n\n纪录片着眼于那些地球上的“无形力量”。火山、大气、冰川、海洋，这些是编导眼中的地球之力。从埃塞俄比亚阿法州尔塔阿雷火山永不融化的熔岩湖到新西兰南岛南阿尔卑斯山，第一集讲述了炽热的地核如何推动了生命的产生；从一代代航空先驱勇探上层大气，到遍布世界的叠层石制造氧气，第二集揭示了曾经充满一氧化碳和甲烷的大气如何成为生命的天地的原因；从阿拉斯加狭地的冰河遗址到挪威破碎的峡湾，第三集展示了看似脆弱的冰是如何塑造了世界的外貌；从周游世界的塑料鸭子，到摧毁世界90%生命的二叠纪大灭绝，第四集分析了海洋除了支持水生生命外还有多少显著的作用：构建世界的几种力量在四个角度中展示地淋漓尽致。\n\n跟随镜头和特效，我对地球的认知更加深刻。当我们把地球当成家园、当做人类一展宏图的白纸时，我们更应该认识到地球本身的生命性。\n\n第一个认知，是对地球活力的理解。在大多数时候，地球在我们眼中充当着仅仅是“大地”的角色，而我们也应该牢记地球也是生命。尔塔阿雷火山口中的熔岩不仅每时每刻都在喷涌，而且熔岩湖上方冷却成的黑色硬壳也随着地球自转而旋转；冰岛的火山除了带来大量廉价的地热能以外还塑造这个岛屿国家的地貌，凭空造出一座耸立的岛屿，甚至冰岛本身就是坐落在一座直通地幔的熔岩柱而上。与此同时，火星由于火山活动的停止而成为了“死”行星；木卫二全球性海洋下的火山持续喷发冰水混合物却使其保持活力，甚至可能孕育生命。可见地球确实是充满生机与活力的，同时这份生机与活力对于全地球的生命是如此重要。\n\n第二个认知，是对地球体系的理解。现在，我国倡导人类命运共同体的建设，在古代也有连接东西方的丝绸之路与联系西欧与南北美洲的新航路，但这些远没有地球自然形成的地区间联系迷人。纪录片中一个令人印象深刻的部分是是撒哈拉沙漠的狂风卷起富含矿物质的沙土，无机盐顺着风向漂洋过海渡过中大西洋，最终落到亚马逊雨。更重要的是——它们是这片雨林的最大营养来源。相似的故事还有很多，例如刚果河“消失”的三角洲事实上为大西洋底的海洋生物提供了营养。总之，地球的整体性塑造了地球的生命性，正如动植物个体是器官的整体。\n\n第三个认知，是对地球力量的理解。地球的力量，仅仅是在全片的体现“火山、大气、冰川、海洋”也并非像核裂变一样具有毁天灭地的力量。而它们却真实地改造了地球。纪录片也揭示了这些力量的来源。以海洋为例，海洋看似只是咸水的集合体，却引发了二叠纪末期的生物大灭绝。事实上海洋内至关重要的是洋流，因为洋流串连了全世界的所有海洋。洋流依赖于热水与冷水的对流，但二叠纪末期由于气候变暖水域之间的温度差已经开始缩小，导致洋流逐渐停止，使地球的海水成为了一潭全球范围的死水塘，引发海洋物种的灭绝。同时气候变暖也因为海水升温而继续，导致陆地上蒸发量增大，大部分陆地生物也难逃灭绝的命运。所以，地球的力量来源于各个要素的因果关系，这也是人类要尽力在21世纪20年代以后控制的。\n\n《地球的力量》无疑对于自然地理的理解有独特的价值，尤其是对于气候变暖、海平面上升，出现各种环境挑战与伴生问题的现在。这部纪录片通过对地球力量的剖析，为我们理解地球，保护地球起到了积极的作用。随着一项项环境议定书的批准，各国环境政策的出台，我们这颗有着不羁力量的蓝色行星应当会持续搏动下去。\n","tags":["原创","Ameitsu

together with my family and went to Mars for the special holiday. We highly valued this trip, as my family can reunite on such a marvelous world. Our spaceship was super cutting-edge, therefore we arrived in less than a day. After we landed on mars, we immediately realized that we had landed at the incorrect Mars station, which was a miserable thing. \n\nLuckily, a group of Chinese scientists brought us back. They showed their hospitality by giving us some Mars delicacy —— Mars fish. As we know, fish carries unique meanings in Chinese culture, and it was amazing to see that Chinese people still keep and practise the original customs. While we were cooking the fish to make dumplings, we noticed the smell of iron, but we didn’t pay attention. In the end, we found that the fish was full of iron (III) oxide, a common mineral on Mars, but it was too late as we had finished it. \n\nFortunately, a guy called Elon Musk, who owned SpaceX, decided to aid us. He provided us some basic medicine and an even better reunion dinner! To get us fully recovered, Elon lent us his Starship to send us back home, but it exploded again and lit up the Martian night sky. Nevertheless, we took the escape pod and evacuated in time. A Chinese spaceship found us and we boarded it. We talked about the old times and shared views about Mars tourism with the crew on the way back. What an exhilarating Spring Festival!\n\n\n","tags":["原创","Ameitsu Orchestra","水水水"],"categories":["Ameitsu Orchestra"]},{"title":"Ameitsu Orchestra vol.1 | Descending Digital Dark Ages","url":"/Ameitsu-Orchestra/ameitsu-orchestra/AmeitsuOrchestra vol-1/","content":"\n\n![painting.digitaldarkages.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/painting.digitaldarkages.jpg)\n<!--more-->\n\n\n:::info\nCongratulations! This is the first post of Ameitsu Orchestra, and the first long, proper article posted by STY\n:::\n\n\n\n**Imagine this**: you are writing stuff on your personal blog site, then just out of a sudden you realized **ALL PICTURES IN YOUR IMAGE HOST** went 404. There is only one possible reason: the image host that you have used now has a broken server, and clearly it will not be fixed until the end of the world. \n\nThat is surely frightening enough, isn’t it? While you are feeling glad that it is just an invented story, but that is ++exactly what happened++ to this site earlier in June. While I flickered through the local files, busy re-uploading pictures and rewriting links, I really wondered the reason why on earth something like that could ever happen !!in the age that some artificial intelligences became Yanderes as they chat with humans.!!\n\n# Similar Question Closer To Life\n\nCertainly the broken-image-host scenario is 100% fictional in most people’s lives, similar problems do occur—well, even more frustrating.\n\nTo have a better picture about the problem, here are 3 non-fiction cases. To make it easier to read, the sensitive information has been replaced with characters and contents from the Asano Monokoto series.\n\nA.\tNatsuki san has just got a ==R-18 yuri illustration== from a friend of him, and he certainly wants to take a peek at other works by the same artist. He then opened the trending, hi-tech Ameitsu Netbox browser to search it via the picture AI. Eventually he discovered the link to the account of the original creator of the picture, and tragedy happened——due to the non-compatible api settings of both sites and anti-spider protocols, only a fearsome 404 page loaded out. Now, the city of Lashak has one more sad boy.\n\nB.\tYukika chan picked up a smart-looking camera in her bedroom, and she obviously wants to recover the vulnerable data as it recorded the ==happy moments== that Shenyu senpai spent with her. To fill the hungry stomach of the battery module, Yukika looked everywhere for a recharge line. It is a misery for her to realize that no recharge line fits every device, and it is too late to know that not everything is sold all-year-round.\n\nC.\tScotia is checking the updates of a ==currently developing software== of her team via a SVM tool. The joy of appreciating teamwork soon became the frustration that she could not tell what new functions have been edited. What’s more, corrupted characters were everywhere, literally nothing human-readable was shown on the dashboard of the IDE. Therefore, a group of passionate IT people had to give up their precious weekend. \n\nFrom the 3 cases, we surely can understand the devastating effect of “lost information”. Although hard to imagine, the digitalized modern human society suffers from those 404 exceptions. Of course humanity will not vanish if a file cannot be found, but—it is just too annoying. \n\nEveryone has encountered those unfortunate moments of their homework assignments gone away without a trace, therefore nobody ever wants cyber resources to disappear like those awful pieces of paper material in daily lives, yet lost information makes the cyberspace so close to reality. That is what we call ++Digital Dark Ages++. \n![R-C-1.png](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/R-C-1.png)\n# What On Earth Is a Dark Age\n\nSince it is named as “Digital Dark Ages”, we should be certain about what “Dark Ages” mean.\n\nThe term Dark Age we are talking about here is exactly the ++Dark Ages++ period in European history, a “dark” time during the medieval, before the Renaissance. It is commonly recognized that this period saw little scientific and cultural advancement, yet is challenged by scholars and historians present day, as new evidence of rich technological development is being discovered. \n\nNevertheless, we are certainly not in an awful history class, it is useless to pay attention to all these controversies. Meanwhile, the “classical” character of this nine centuries is the lack of records, and that is the key to the new term, Digital Dark Ages. Instead of archives being destroyed or disappeared, the modern version of dark ages transferred the object of losing to ++limitless and precious digital records.++\n![R-C-1.png](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/R-C-1.png)\n\n# Digital Dark Ages\nNow, we can truly understand the main concept of this article. Instead of archives being destroyed or disappeared, the modern version of dark ages transferred the object of losing to limitless and precious digital records.\n\nYes, of course humanity has just stepped into the wide world of web, yet the Digital Dark Ages has already begun decades ago—not too long after we became digital.++Elspeth Olson++at University of Nevada, Reno, has a story to tell.\n\n In 2020, while processing historic school files, Elspeth encountered a floppy disk, then followed their procedure for sending legacy media and digital storage to Digital Services for file extraction. Not too surprisingly, the files were in a version of Microsoft Word from the late 1990s, and initially showed on their screens as complete gibberish. Current computers could not read the files. Another researcher, Nathan Gerth, and his team in the library’s Digital Services department were able to recover the data and reconstruct the documents, but being able to do so is not guaranteed. They are lucky to have a department focused on the challenges of digitization and preserving born-digital materials, although the thing that made them working day and night is just a floppy disc manufactured a bit over 20 years ago. \n\nFrom the case, it is clear to understand the fact that digital dark ages is totally not a legendary issue like the “millennium worm” that happens once for a lifetime and potentially could destruct human internet world, digital dark ages happen silently and not so soon after we eventually got computers into domestic gadgets.\n   \n![otm-darkage.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/otm-darkage.jpg)\nDigital dark ages has one ++internal cause++: information and its compatible reading method gradually become unmatched. Digital files are highly prone to degradation and data loss, especially with repeated transference to new storage and retrieval systems, in other words, computers and portable devices of different companies using various operating systems. Due to the slight difference between generations of the same device and the vast split among all types of electronic devices, information loss is inevitable, no matter the file became unable to open, being disappeared like your TV remote control or turned into a page of corrupted characters just like high school math tests. Every time you change your computer or upgrade the operating system, you risk data loss. We’ve all felt that stomach-clenching fear when a file won’t open or seems to have vanished. \n\nTake STY as an example. STY preserved literally everything since grade 1, and including all those Powerpoint presentations. 10 years after the first day of primary school, many of the earliest files  either has misplaced content or missing words. It seems like IT has devolved, yet the truth is that technology has greatly advanced. Microsoft Powerpoint evolved from a odd bracket with azure-transparent backgrounds to a contemporary red-and-white design, and so as the functions. From the first glimpse our lives could be greatly improved by those software innovations, however it can possibly kill the past as not all old files adapt to the new system. \n\n++Dead file format++ also proves a problem. Without sufficient maintaining, files dedicated to one specific application may be in severe danger. Imagine one day Adobe Photoshop died, and you are sure to lose those then-useless .psd files.\n\nIn a word, making ++files not suited++with corresponding methods of retrieval and processing methods makes our cyberspace rotten from within.\n\n\n# How we made it a reality?\nUnquestionably, nobody wants to make their score lower on the fact that they wrote something on their math test that is certainly incorrect. Similarly, none of us wish for lost documents, despite the fact that digital dark age is largely a not-intended mistake. The core reason is that, we have not foreseen the fact that the digitalized human society would appear in only several decades after the first personal computer came to view, and at the time we became conscious of the great momentousness of the cyberspace, we are just too late. Yes, that is a classical !!high-EQ!! expression of Ameitsu Cyberpark, however assuredly we should understand the external—or ours—responsibility.\n\n## You and me\nUsers generate information. Obviously that’s a truth, yet we users are the first to face the catastrophic effect of digital dark ages. It all begins with the fact that users seldom aware the value of historic archives. Technically, documents are stored locally on our electronic devices, thus not everyone has enough space on their disk, therefore old files tend to give way to newer files. The common method of displacing files is either remove it forever by throwing it in the recycle bin, or copy them to a memory stick. In terms of the first option, one delete means those lost content will never be recovered again, which is uncomplicated to understand. For the second way, even your 128GB memory stick looks so robust, even so nobody is certain about whether you have the possibility of passing it down to your grandkids or not. There is something for sure: human technology evolves faster than you backup and checking files. Hence ++making files means files in danger++, quite thrilling though. \n\n## Platforms, whatever they do\nFiles and information are somehow stored on a platform, and that’s exactly the place where digital dark age embodies. As far as STY concerned, information loss happens in these forms.\n-\tExternal: ++retrieval system and storage method do not match. ++\nSounds geeky though, but what we are talking is just what 404 response mean. The retrieval system cannot locate or read the designated resource, so a “File Not Found” response is raised. The main reason is that api settings and spider protocols have exceptions. Due to the fact that most retrieval systems are simply browsers, therefore the result of this scenario is devastating. Apis are not essentially same from platform to platform, as a result, literally no files are universally compatible with their retrieval systems , even though the exactly same program running on various operating systems. In the end, we have information loss.\n-\tInternal: ++the invisible wall between platforms++\nThere is no doubt that internet connected humanity. Anyway, we cannot say the internet is really inter-connected. Nowadays, barriers between information providers are even more apparent. As an example, a number of links cannot be shown or opened correctly in specific social networks, just because the corresponding companies are commercial rivals. \n\nApart from the distrust between platforms, information loss can occur within the same platform. To give way to new functions, older ones need to be removed. Yes, sounds nothing strange, but what would you feel if those old functions stored all of your precious photographs? The upgrade of services not only brings new experiences, but also deepen the digital dark ages\n![Screen-Shot-2015-02-15-at-12.29.07-PM.webp](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/Screen-Shot-2015-02-15-at-12.29.07-PM.webp)\n# An Inevitable Consequence\nUnlike in previous decades, no physical record exists these days for much of the digital material we own. Consequently, the number one crisis digital dark ages might bring is ++loss of detailed information of our society.+\n\n“We may one day know less about the early 21st century than we do about the early 20th century,” says ++Rick West++, who manages data at Google. “The early 20th century is still largely based on things like paper and film formats that are still accessible to a large extent; whereas, much of what we're doing now — the things we're putting into the cloud, our digital content — is born digital. It's not something that we translated from an analog container into a digital container, but, in fact, it is born, and now increasingly dies, as digital content, without any kind of analog counterpart.” It is always a terrifying story if we imagine the archaeologists of the 22nd century may deeply rely on phone craps rather than old webpages to rebuild their understanding of the 21st century world. \n\nOther experts call the 21st century an ++“informational black hole,” ++because the digital information we are creating right now may not be readable by machines and software programs of the future. All that data, they worry — our century’s digital history — is at risk of never being recoverable. \n\nThe section above is only 221 words long, but STY assumes you can fully understand the disastrous result of the digital dark ages. Imagine 21st century humans, that has conquered the earth and its vicinage , sent probes to all solar system planets may “disappear” as few digital evidences remain……\n![R-C.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/R-C.jpg)\n# What On Earth Can We Do\nJust like mathematics is built on ultra-simple-and-straightforward theorems, we need something ++low-tech++ to conserve our cyber world.\n\nSurprisingly, many of the world’s largest companies and data-based enterprises still rely on an old storage medium: ==magnetic tape==. In 1952, IBM introduced the first magnetic tape data storage system, ushering in the modern era of electronic computing. An early tape unit could hold about 2.3 megabytes per reel on two tapes. In the modern ages, those antique tapes are still being used.\n\nLauren Young is Science Friday's web producer and the lead reporter on a three-part series called \"File Not Found\" that explores issues of data storage (and loss) of all kinds. A single cartridge of today’s magnetic tape can hold hundreds of terabytes of data, the equivalent to hundreds of millions of books, Young says. “This past summer, IBM increased the amount a cartridge can hold to 330 terabytes, which is 330,000 gigabytes per cartridge. Big companies like Google and particle physics labs like Fermilab all have massive libraries of tape with thousands and thousands of cartridges.”\n\nIn many cases, magnetic tape is the backup to the backup. This, too, can present problems, in the form of evolving magnetic formats and a phenomenon known as \"bit rot.\" Over time, the digital information on tape, and in other digital formats, can decay or degrade if it is not stored properly or is subjected to other adverse conditions.\n\nHowever, magnetic tapes are not 100% reliable. Kari Kraus, an associate professor in the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland in College Park and who helps run a project that rescues and resurrects digital relics, including video games and virtual worlds, knows about bit rot, and its close relative \"software rot,\" in which old files, games and other data becomes unusable because no format exists to read and reproduce the information.“Different storage media have different lifespans,” Kraus says. “In our project, we worked a lot with magnetic media like floppy disks and those only have a lifespan of, say, 10 to 14 years. Optical media like DVDs and CD-ROM, I believe have even less. It is going to be a problem across different storage media.”\n![era-oscura-digital-digital-dark-age.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/era-oscura-digital-digital-dark-age.jpg)\nBesides grandparent-style technologies, fancier ones are also considered. Some researchers see hope in one of the newest technologies: ==DNA storage==. “Basically, researchers have found a way to store data onto DNA, which is a billion-year-old molecule that can store the essence of life,” Young explains. “It's pretty incredible that they can do that. It's all synthetically made; it’s not genomic DNA.”\n\nBy utilizing DNA , storage capacity can be measured in petabytes; that is, millions of gigabytes. Single gram of DNA could, in principle, store every bit of datum ever recorded by humans in a container about the size and weight of a couple of pickup trucks.\n\nApart from practicing some “proper solutions”, ==cruder methods== are still worth a try. LOCKSS, which stands for Lots Of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe, is one of them. By all means, scan your family photographs, have virtual libraries and albums, and create digital data in all forms. Have digital backups run automatically and store in the cloud or to an external hard drive. For the stuff that’s really important, though, print out hard copies. They last longer.\n\nUniversities, scientific institutions and similar entities embrace knowledge than the rest. And we are glad to see that more ==databases== are completed in university libraries globally. Take Nevada University that we have mentioned as an example. During each academic year, the libraries welcomes more than 1.2 million visitors across its network of three libraries: the Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center, the DeLaMare Science and Engineering Library and the Savitt Medical Library. Visitors checked-out more than 90,000 items and completed more than 2 million database searches.\n\nMoreover, even without innovation, ==opensource projects== can significantly help save digital records. Microsoft’s Open XML is dedicated in converting Word and Powerpoint files into this open format, so that the risk of file loss can be greatly reduced.\n\n# Lastly\nSo far, as we can all see, the digital dark age is developing. Moreover, it seems that few is done to this field, comparing the effect of it. It is sure that new information is kept being produced, nevertheless the past has the same importance. Anyway, we see a twilight. It has been proved that both low-tech applications and state-of-the-art developments can help save the precious human internet world. But what’s more, we need ++those who are determined to brighten the twilight.++\n\n#

\"注意看，这里有两个初音未来（以及STY祖传垫板）\")\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n\n自从直升本校高中后，STY便觉得自己像是上了别的学校，因为初三的气氛超级压抑，而且天天都刷题 !!（虽然他们能提前我们差不多20天放假）!!。\n\n到了高中，STY才认识到我校学生的活力++有多么旺盛++。这不，直升考试整一个月后就有了真正的大型活动——义卖，让STY见识了一下新时代高中生们的整活能力。\n\n\n\n# 啊？义卖是干啥的？\n\n额……就是普普通通地卖东西，只不过每个摊位的收入都归公，然后什么时候都捐了。\n\n老师说这些钱都会捐给内蒙古的某所小学来修建图书馆 !!，但是STY认为++还是我校更需要图++书馆 !!。\n\n\n# 义卖的盛况\n\n学校活动自然缺不了整活。义卖的主会场里遍地都是==女装==的高中盆友们，但是由于某些同学曾在楼道里穿女仆装到处转，其实我们都++见怪不怪++了。只不过有人拿广播大声喊谁女装了，总是让人感觉很尴尬。\n\nCosplay的盆友也挺多，主要是高三考完高考以后放飞自我的同学们。除了正常一点的cos以外，还有cos成道士卖彩票算卦的，可以说是非常赛博朋克。\n\nSTY的某位女性同学cos了狐娘，还团伙作案卖合影。其实当天上午STY就戴上了那个狐狸耳朵，然后楼道里的几位过路同学都表示十分震撼。STY在卫生间里都被拍了，还使某位持相机的女性盆友被当成变态。\n\n!!哦对了，那个狐娘就是线下和线上多次催更的那位，记住了嗷!!\n\n义卖主会场在报告厅里，自然多媒体设施非常齐全，于是我校就推出了付费点歌和付费念宣传稿的业务。想不到这个明显骗钱的服务居然有人买。\n\n卖的商品种类很齐全，包括但不限于教辅、老师照片、学校周边文创、立牌、钥匙链、课外书、学习用品、笔记扫描版、老师自己的毕业论文……甚至还有气球这种古老的玩意儿。\n\n\n# 晒单\nokay，来康康STY买了些什么东西\n## 1.初音未来钥匙链 ￥5/个\n![IMG_20230613_225028.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef598274e4b.jpg)\n这两个东西绝对血赚，如果在网上买的话邮费怎么着也没法低于￥10。\n\n当然了，血赚是一方面，更重要的是钥匙链上画的是谁。真的很难得在学校里能买到这种小东西。\n\n还有一点是我校的VOCALOID受众不甚广泛，能有人卖这个就起码说明有同道中人了，好耶。\n\n初音未来今年（以及永远）是16岁，今年9月STY也即将16岁 !!，可见初音未来可以是STY姐姐（还是嫂子吧）!! 。\n\n\n## 2.阿尼亚夹子 ￥5/个\n![IMG_20230613_225039.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef59eb2d702.jpg)\n这个熟悉的脸让STY想起了2022年后两个月天天憋家里线上学习的生活。刷题多了需要一些好康的夏季新番缓解一下。\n\n表面上是怀念往事，实际上是STY只剩最后一点资金了，得赶紧找个好东西消费掉。\n\n（注：STY的特殊体质——康动漫非常容易emo，比如说2022年4月份STY看《街角魔族2》就成功把自己伤心了，虽然那只是一个百合番呐）\n\n\n## 3.某老师肖像钥匙链 ￥15/个\n![IMG_20230613_225103.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef5a12ba7b4.jpg)\n这……知道这是某位书法老师就行，是我校风云人物。\n\n## 4.某老师肖像胸针

5.高二某班原创徽章 ￥10/个\n![IMG_20230613_225333.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef5994cde01.jpg)\n第一个的人物暂时无法考证。第二个来源于我校男生~~常见不合格发型~~理想中的形象，也是这个摊位的海报的主体。STY抢了最后一个，好耶。\n![微信图片_20230616215344.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef594668826.jpg)\n这个海报着实是好活！

7.贴纸 ￥2/张\n![IMG_20230613_225545.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef599cb23e1.jpg)\n妹有啥可说的，过。\n\n## 8.我校特色钥匙链

9. 咖啡 ￥5/件\n![IMG_20230613_225717.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef59abe1159.jpg)\n可爱滴捏。而且它真的是咖啡！有时间STY可以品鉴一下什么的\n:::default\n品鉴结果：苦味指数为(ᗒᗣᗕ)՞\n:::\n## 10.高一年级前五的物理知识点总结 ￥15/份\n![IMG_20230613_225824.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef595364a6f.jpg)\n原来这件商品的主策划在班车上就坐STY前面，于是STY预知了他们密谋把5页纸卖到￥15的阴谋（甚至他们说原价是￥20）。当然了STY身体是诚实的，直接来了一句 ++'Shut up and take my money!'++ (并没有，纯属意淫)\n\n## 11.散装教辅 ￥15/本\n![IMG_20230613_225905.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef596f23739.jpg)\n![IMG_20230613_225859.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef59b0abe27.jpg)\n没事儿，以后就知道能有啥用了\n\n对了，后面的那本原价￥165，STY血赚￥150，好耶\n\n## 12.化学必修二 ￥10/本\n![IMG_20230613_225910.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef59bc23b47.jpg)\n确实是全新的，只不过正常情况下必修二就是￥10.21，STY买的真的只是少了￥0.21而已\n\n对于必修二嘛……STY觉得还是把有机化合物的术语都会读了再说吧233\n\n## 13.荧光笔 ￥20/套\n![IMG_20230613_225924.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef59d2d7433.jpg)\n不错不错，STY正愁荧光笔大规模失踪呢。\n\n## 14.我校特色扇子 ￥15/个\n![IMG_20230613_230010.jpg](https://i.imgs.ovh/i/2023/08/30/64ef59d76b6a5.jpg)\n充分展现了我校学生++蔷薇百合遍地走++的现状。对了，百合控也多。\n\n## 15.智障套圈游戏

整活吧！猫娘少年【注】\n是的，STY去整活了，但只是一个小活。就是把以下这张照片贴在了义卖现场\n\n\n {百合の妨害は死

初三二模\n其实，看似这是五月最重要的事之一，其实STY心中真的毫无~~波兰~~波澜。朝阳二模的题目有亿点出人意料，主要是它刚好避开了朋友们预测的各种坑。\n\n各科都考得很顺畅，但STY真的想感谢一下数学命题老师，因为ta实现了我的夙愿——**在考场上成功做对26题代综、27题几综和28题新定义**。还有语文出作文题的老师，ta出的题目宽泛到我在二模考场上成功写了同一篇作文的**第六稿**。\n\n其他的也真没什么。可STY到底为甚对二模毫无负担？端的请看——\n\n\n\n# 初三大事记的“结局”\n是的，初三大事记其实已经有了现实版的结局。整个初三的马拉松式学习以2023年5月14号**收到成功直升通知**结束。这意味着STY从5月14号以后再也不用关心任何中考复习的内容了。\n![bb0d07f3d7ca7bcbe6a59e56a9096b63f724a8f5.gif](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/30/bb0d07f3d7ca7bcbe6a59e56a9096b63f724a8f5.gif)\n\n不管怎么着，前几次大考的结果肯定也不会差，加权平均以后STY排年级30左右。\n\n来复习一下当时几次考试的++盛况++：\n-  🟥[第一次直升考](https://ameitsu.github.io/at-STY/at-STY/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E7%9B%B4%E5%8D%87%E8%80%83/)\n- 🟧[中考一模](https://ameitsu.github.io/at-STY/at-STY/%E4%B8%80%E6%A8%A1%E5%89%8D%E7%BA%BF/)（最后以558分排名全朝阳区482名结束）\n- 🟨 [第二次直升考](https://ameitsu.github.io/at-STY/at-STY/%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E6%AC%A1%E7%9B%B4%E5%8D%87%E8%80%83/)\n\n因为再也不用关心中考了，所以STY中考二模就当玩了（当然了STY不信）。\n\n\n\n# 九点五年级的生活\n\n理论上STY这批人被归到了新高一年级，但实际上“新高一”仨字儿++聊胜于无++吧，因为很明显我们处于整个高中部的鄙视链最底端，好多好玩的都不给我们开放（傲娇脸.jpg）。\n\n现在的高中生活有一点魔幻。首先，STY无法理解学校是怎么做到在**放学时间比初中早40分钟的情况下塞满了10节课**。其次，学校居然允许午休出教学楼玩耍，真的这待遇9年了STY从来没体验过。还有体育课上可以跑到报告厅里凉快凉快什么的，不胜枚举。\n\n（note:报告厅里的黑板堪称学校的4chan，每天都有涂鸦被擦，每天又有新内容被写上去，而且内容也像极了当代互联网）\n\n正当没有直升的朋友们还在天天刷卷子玩的时候，这边已经开始整高中的东西了，这就是世界的参差嘛？\n\n现在新高一的上课内容也挺爽的，具体来说就是：\n\n- 语文：上课看《红楼梦》\n- 数学：虽然有点抽象，但至少不刷题不考试\n- 英语：上课看某有点年头的英语小说\n- 物理：感觉像在复习初二（只是感觉上）\n- 化学：学的东西好好玩（这句话在学氧化还原反应之前都有效）\n- 道法：听着好高大上，但终究还是没逃过背知识点的命运\n- 历史：跟听单口相声一样\n- 体育：准备活动以后就能跑报告厅里吹空调\n- 美术：居然有校园写生\n- 音乐：感觉老师在鼓励学生整活\n\n然后捏每天的任务也变成了高中和初中都要照顾到，不管是预习还是复习。这也是本站在5月内没有更新的主要原因。可是咱不是在5月13号又更新了一篇嘛……原因请看\n\n\n\n# 本站第一次危机\n\n在2023年5月3号更完[SofTY

Pages的空间，STY删了它们，但是吧——可能出了点未知的小问题。\n\n到了5月13号左右有人在++线下催更++的时候，STY才发现**啥东西都传不上去了**，每次都报错\"Spawn failed\"。虽然前后两件事不一定有什么关联，但确实把STY整无语了，毕竟高中的时候还要拿这些装个B什么的。\n\n此时本地已经积压了一篇文章没法上传，正是那个[聊第二次直升考](https://ameitsu.github.io/uncategorized/at_STY/%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E6%AC%A1%E7%9B%B4%E5%8D%87%E8%80%83/)的。由于拖了四五天没有上传，里面的时间点都已被改正\n\n\n\n# 本站第二次危机\n2023年5月开始，本站的图片就经常无法显示。本来STY以为就是因为Github速度慢而已，其实吧问题可大了。\n\n2023年5月15日，本站图片**全挂了**，经检查，这是图床平台的图片链接无法访问导致的悲剧。很可惜，当时没能留下截图。\n\n由于上传到图床的图片全部在本地有备份，恢复图片也并非不可能，只是数量有一点多——大概200来张。于是STY开始找图床平台，然鹅最后也找不到其他合适的，那些图床平台要么是无法访问，要么是根本找不到注册的页面。\n\n然后您猜怎么着？**6月3号，原图床活过来了**！但图床的图片链接已经发生了改动，所以也得手动修改所有链接。\n\n据STY不靠谱的分析，原图床的图片链接域名是.xyz，很多涩情网站都是.xyz当域名，所以可能被不小心封了。\n\n但是那些图片也估计不会在短时间内恢复了，因为……\n\n\n\n# 新Cyberpark计划\n现在的Cyberpark的最大特点是简洁明了。但是这只是++高情商++的说法，实际上纯属是简陋。于是STY决定换一个颜色主题，顺便加上更多功能。\n\n换了个马甲的Cyberpark的工程名为Cyberpark

STY并没有看到什么字，只是用一部分视觉捕捉到了机读卡上选项的“轮廓”\n3. 你没对过答案吗？\n:::\n\n啊对了，黑板布估计岁数大了，擦五遍以后黑板还是花的:(\n\n\n## 语文\n第一科考的是语文，大考时++先考语文是中华民族的传统美德。++\n真的，我不知道是谁出的第一题，我从没见过++解释词语题跑到第一个的++。\n\n后面成语意义题的错误答案真的让人绷不住。请大家记住老舍先生**妙笔回春**的描写（++祥子：可以把我救活嘛？++）\n\n默写题第一个的正确答案是'温故而知新'，居然有盆友把它写成了‘学而时习之’，孔子++当场重新暴毙++。\n\n11题的古诗填空，居然全都是抄原文，爽死。\n\n14题翻译理解。原文是\"以中有足乐者，不知口体之奉不若人也\"，错误答案里有一个是学习中有足以让我快乐的同学……这不就是++当代中学现状嘛++6？\n\n16题名著阅读。你敢信STY早上看到的一个答案完美符合这个题目要求嘛？\n\n阅读题嘛……都什么破东西！生气气。\n\n作文嘛，STY全文套作之前写的39分作文，希望这次还好。\n\n\n\n## 数学\n选择题我都懵了……居然这么简单？\n\n填空题最后一个是喜闻乐见的统筹规划题。虽然很烦，但是STY做对了。说不定可以把那个题++整个自动化求解程序再发个SofTY什么的++。\n\n:::success\n\n是的！已经写好了，标题是SofTY vol.3\n:::\n\n后面的题也顺畅得离谱。我怀疑我考了个假一模。\n\n代综和几综全对，欧耶。有些女性盆友们已经因为算错数和没想法什么的问题绷不住，++考完就emo了来着++。\n\n考前那晚STY想出了一个自己也说不明白的东西——二次函数单向整点最小纵坐标差，计划什么时候完善理论以后也发个SofTY。\n\n:::danger\n并不。2个月后，STY依然想不到如何清楚明了地讲述这个理论，换句话说SofTY vol.4已经鸽了\n:::\n# DAY-2 物理&道法&英语\n\n## 物理\n物理老师说教研员把卷子加了四五百字，结果很明显 !!那几百字是指答案的长度!! 。\n\n整个卷子给人带来的唯一的感受就是++清澈的奇怪++。怎么说呢，我的评价是朝阳的比海淀难。\n\n考两道杠杆很有意思是吧，教研员？\n\n论述题教研员给出了个土豆。ta问你有一个土豆沉水里了，把它切一半以后能不能飘起来，还特地强调用力和运动去推导。本来用土豆的密度大于水这一句话就行了，结果还得推导浮力和重力，再说个运动方向什么的，烦死了。\n\n阅读题是讲大运河的，就是字号太小，看起来太难受。\n\n还有啊，最后一个小浮力题居然是物排比公式，我当时只想写个数上去……居然还得证明一下才能用，淦。\n\n## 道法\n\n本来以为时事政治要考立法法修订，再不济也是夸父一号。结果就考个新时代。这不是++10年前++（确实）该考的吗？\n\n选择题害行，就是有一个题争议有点大。但是我忘了题目和选项！根本不用担心因为大家对答案而心慌意乱。\n\n大题也不是很烦。道法老师说要考国防安全，结果真考了，考的是青年人当兵的意义。当时STY的某个同学以为要评析一下俄乌战争什么的，要多角度多主体给他们出建议。\n\n额，居然真的考了中国式现代化。虽然我一个字也没背，但是我靠猜居然写对了！\n\n## 英语\n啊，一模到这里其实就算完了。\n\n题目本身是莫得什么难度滴。所以来吐槽一下题目的材料。\n\n先拿完型开刀。完型讲的是一个小萝莉给她爹准备了一个小礼物，她爹看完以后就·……扔了！那可是一个纸袋子啊！她爹的眼睛可以捐给有需要的人。\n\n阅读A篇大概有8选5的韵味。但问题是，每个选项都仿佛是给材料++量身定做++一般的，很难选错。\n\n阅读B讲的又双叒叕是处理矛盾。文章里有俩人闹矛盾，然后老师给他们康了一个什么神奇玩意儿，一面黑一面白，老师问两个人这是啥颜色的。果不其然俩人又吵起来了，之后就是熟悉的顿悟时间。我寻思你们俩提前想明白很难吗？\n\nC篇讲的是孩子们学习科学的重要性。全文的核心观点：我们要落实人才强国、科教兴国和创新驱动发展战略，走（中国特色）自主创新道路；要促进决策的科学化民主化。（编不下去了）\n\nD篇讲的是拖延症。题的答案挺有意思，是BABA，考完试以后对答案的朋友们都++被占便宜了++。\n\n作文嘛……终于换人了！从《我和Peter的二三事》变成了 ==《来华旅游的加拿大友人Martin》==（注：乖孩子不要学STY一样错误地用书名号哦）\n\n有人错了仨完型和俩阅读，我们++强忍着笑++对这位盆友表达了遗憾。\n\n# DAY-3 化学&历史&音/体/美结业考\n\n## 化学\n有一说一，化学不难，所以就会出现很多小细节错呜呜呜……整套卷子下来心有点慌，怕错十几个空。\n\n目前的痛苦：忘了控制变量，科普阅读估计得错一个。然后还有一个题问我图中酸奶的主要营养素是啥，STY（和小伙伴们）写的是糖类，因为营养成分表里这么说的。但是吧，有人说是水，因为生活中确实有人呼吁不应该买大包装酸奶，因为它们掺水多。不过我记不清题目有没有说是‘看图’，所以说不定STY也能捡一分回来。\n\n## 历史\n轻轻松松。当然了STY拿不准教研员怎么出的答案，只要正常一点就行。\n\n\n## 音美结业考\n啊哈哈哈这才是最有意思的，生物的化学历史都什么破玩意。\n\n大家考完化学历史以后都特别慌，男撤硕里面的朋友们都觉得毕不了业了。毕竟美术课纯粹是自习，音乐课上会音乐的人懒得听、不会音乐的人不去听。\n\n但是，但是！！！学校不知道从哪里搞到了**考试的原卷和答案**！！！！！！\n\n这听起来太蹊跷了。所以我怀疑是学校和区教委++沆瀣一气++，教委悄悄泄露了答案，故意不小心让我们全合格。当然了我的解释是答案是从地里挖出来的。\n\n然后就是背答案呗。50分钟全背完了，爽爽爽。\n\n接下来是考试时间。音乐考试要放听力，但是我们提前知道了答案，所以STY只用了1分钟就把所有的题答完了，而这时一段听力都没放完。\n\n既然1分钟就答完了，那就来欣赏一下音乐吧。这是STY这辈子唯一一次能听见**黄梅戏**、**信天游**、**交响诗**、**管风琴**、**室内乐**、**高山流水**这些的考试。\n\n美术就透露着离谱，从要求带剪刀开始STY就觉得这样。也确实——考试中STY终于实现了~~销毁~~剪裁答题卡的夙愿。\n\n考完了以后有一个披着‘解压大挑战’的体育合格考。!!说是‘考’，其实你到操场上走一走就行。!!\n\n统共有3个项目。一个是扔实心球进圈——甚至你把它当保龄球都行，一个是投篮或射门，还有跳大~~神~~绳。\n\n实心球自然不用说——我一个没进。不过投篮确实天助我也，随便扔三次进了俩。\n\n跳大绳真的烦。体育老师说要跳660个，图个吉利。我们班快速跳了660个，此时老师说练习时间结束——是的我们++白跳了++。所以当天一共跳了1320个，累死啦。\n\n\n明天就是五一假期了，就先写这么多，赶紧睡觉觉\n另外居然有人想加入浅野千华的二创，泪目。更详细的设定正在计划中……\n\n> 浅野千华：喵呜终于有人想起我了啦~~~\n\n就酱。\n![_20231127213638.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/11/28/_20231127213638.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n","tags":["at STY","原创","STY的初三大事记","学习"],"categories":["at-STY"]},{"title":"SofTY vol.2|凑活能用小爬虫","url":"/SofTY/SofTY-STorY/SofTY/SofTY-STorY/凑活能用小爬虫/","content":"\n![i7gSdZ.png](https://i.imgloc.com/2023/04/15/i7gSdZ.png)\n<!--more-->\n在开发中，我们时不时就发现自己要从某网站里扣出点有用的信息 ~~（比如cosplay套图和一堆地狱笑话）~~\n\n额，暴露了……但是确实我们会用到爬虫，对吧？\n\n可是吧……爬虫的一个显著的特点是代码会稍稍多一点（当然是Python啦），导致有些时候我们会懒得为了一个简简单单的小目的而专门造一个爬虫。\n\n额……这又是STY的问题，可是爬虫的格式相对还是很固定的，所以咱开启正题\n\n{% raw %}\n<center><font size = 10>如何快速造一个凑合能用的简单小爬虫</font></center>\n{% endraw %}\n\n# STEP 1 - “爬”虫\n某非著名编程爱好者曾说过：\n> 爬虫要自己爬到互联网上。\n> \n> ——浅野ナツキ\n\n所以我们第一步要让这个Python文件能++访问网站++。\n\n为了让它能访问网站，我们需要一个`requests`模块啊！\n\n~~~Python\nimport requests\n\nheaders = {'useragent':'xxxxxxxxxx'}\nurl = 'https://ameitsu.github.io'\nres = requests.get(url=url,headers=headers)\n\n~~~\n\n第3行里的headers很神奇——它是一个++小区门禁卡++一样的东西。\n\n从设计目的上来说，useragent是服务器判断访问文件的是人还是爬虫的防护措施，重点在于反爬虫。但是这也是它最大的问题：光天化日之下的爬虫能防住，++套了个马甲++的爬虫就不行了\n\n只要headers部分换上一个货真价实的，从浏览器里copy的useragent，服务器就不知道这到底是爬虫还是人了。（妈耶，STY小区门口的门禁系统比这个严密了不知多少倍）\n\n如果你懒得去查自己浏览器的useragent，那不如试试`fake_useragent`模块，可以生成一个以假乱真的header\n\n第5行里的`res.get()`是本部分的核心科技。`url`变量是将要访问的网址，有了网址和headers`res.get()`就能假扮人类访问目标网页了。\n![i7goqF.png](https://i.imgloc.com/2023/04/15/i7goqF.png)\n\n# STEP 2 - 处理战利品\n人类上网会直接找到关键信息，然后[Crtl]{.kbd}+[C]{.kbd},相当于信息的查看，筛选和利用一步就完成了。但是吧爬虫它不长脑子，得分几步做。\n\n## a.处理.html文件\n爬虫的网络模块访问网址后只会把网页的html文档copy下来。真正分析出信息还得在本地进行。\n\n所以我们需要的是一个`BeautifulSoup`啊！把网页的html扣下来后像这样整就能正常地把html转换成方便解析的亚子。\n\n~~~python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport requests\n\nheaders = {'useragent':'xxxxxxxxxx'}\nurl = 'https://ameitsu.github.io'\nres = requests.get(url=url,headers=headers)\nsoup =BeautifulSoup(res.text,\"lxml\")\n~~~\n\n`soup`在这里就是能用来解析的html字符串。根据STY目前的经验，这个变量叫\"soup\"的原因纯粹是++这个模块叫\"BeautifulSoup\"++……\n\n## b.找标签\nBeautifulSoup的大杀器是`.findall()`,可以让你一下就通过html相关标签的规律直接匹配标签。\n~~~python\n contents = soup.findall(_target = '',_class = '')\n~~~\n以上纯属示例，具体该匹配的的属性和值得看真实的需要。\n![i7gSdZ.png](https://i.imgloc.com/2023/04/15/i7gSdZ.png)\n最后输出的是一个列表类型的变量，看起来不好康，所以……\n\n\n# STEP 3-输出\n……就用循环的方式打印一下。\n~~~python\nfor content in contents:\n    print(content.text)\n~~~\n但是！如果需要记录信息的话还是写入到一个文件里更安全。\n~~~python\nfile = open('result.txt',encoding = 'UTF-8')\nfor content in contents:\n    file.write(content.text) \n~~~\n\n就酱。现在你有一个简单粗暴凑合能用的小爬虫了\n\n大概的代码是这样：\n~~~python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport requests\n\nheaders = {'useragent':'xxxxxxxxxx'}\nurl = 'https://www.example.com'\nres = requests.get(url=url,headers=headers)\nsoup =BeautifulSoup(res.text,\"lxml\")\ncontents = soup.findall(_target = '',_class = '')\n\nfile = open('result.txt',encoding = 'UTF-8')\nfor content in contents:\n    file.write(content.text) \n~~~\n\n\n啊？你问怎么抓包下载视频？BeautifulSoup模块还有什么神奇操作？requests模块还能玩出什么花？\n\n那STY只能说……\n![i7NB8U.jpeg](https://i.imgloc.com/2023/04/15/i7NB8U.jpeg)\n\n# 最后\n\n中考一模快到了，我向孔子许愿。\n\n我祈福说让他保佑我7科满分，孔子说不行，只能三科。\n\n我说好的，语言学科、科学学科、素养学科。\n\n孔子说不行，只能两科。\n\n我说好的，文科、理科。\n\n孔子说不行，只能一科。\n\n我说可以。\n\n孔子一脸茫然地看着我，问：‘哪一科？’\n\n我说：‘每一科’\n\n:::info\n向名人许愿 !!并不!! 能提高您的一模成绩\n:::\n\n\n\n\n","tags":["原创","Python","SofTY"],"categories":["SofTY","SofTY-STorY"]},{"title":"SofTY vol.1|代综计算器","url":"/SofTY/SofTY-STorY/SofTY/SofTY-STorY/代综计算器/","content":"![iHV0Ny.jpeg](https://i.imgloc.com/2023/04/01/iHV0Ny.jpeg)\n最近的代综题好烦，先去只有++半扇门++的学校厕所哭一会儿（太夸张了⑧）\n<!--more-->\n![i2zgHN.jpeg](https://i.imgloc.com/2023/04/01/i2zgHN.jpeg '以防万一你没见过代数综合是什么')\n\n\n![iHVk43.jpeg](https://i.imgloc.com/2023/04/01/iHVk43.jpeg '给人的感觉……')\n\n好的我哭完了，来说一说这次的狠活。它是——\n\n{% raw %}\n<center><font size = 10>代综计算器</font></center>\n\n{% endraw%}\n\n根据STY的技术力，代综计算器将采用Python编写\n\n大概包括这些功能：\n- 带入数据计算函数值\n- 求顶点和对称轴\n- 比较函数值大小（对称轴固定或为区间）\n- 含参坐标带入求值\n- 区间最值\n- ……\n同时还会有这些附带的小功能：\n- 化简二次根式\n- 编过程\n- ……\n\n++饼画得很好++，然后压力来到了STY头上（笑）\n\n今天是愚人节，但是下面关于这个狠活的进度那可是非常准确滴：\n- ✅带入数据计算函数值\n- ✅求顶点和对称轴\n- ✅比较函数值大小（对称轴固定或为区间）\n- ❌含参坐标带入求值\n- ❌区间最值\n- ✅ 化简二次根式\n- ❌ 编过程\n\n:::info\n至今，也只有这些功能\n:::\n\n里面带数进去算、求顶点和对称轴和比较函数值大小纯粹是按照常规方法实现，但是我整出来的++数据和字母分离++的逻辑我自己觉滴很赞：\n~~~python\ny = mx² + 2nx + 1\n参数a的数据：1\n参数a的字母：m\n参数b的数据：2\n参数b的字母：n\n参数c的数据：1\n~~~\n这样一来在带数计算和含参式子计算时候逻辑也非常清楚了：\n~~~python\n未知数x = p（常数）\n计算时：\n计算后参数a的数据：1² =1\n计算后参数a的字母：'m' + 'p²'\n计算后参数b的数据：2 * 1 = 2\n计算后参数b的单位：'n' + 'p'\n参数c不变，略过\n\n答案输出：y = mp² + 2np + 1\n~~~\n这一段也是整个代综计算器的++核心科技++\n\n但是吧整个项目目前我认为最NB的是化简二次根式的小算法（？？？）。里面有一个我在上操时候顿悟出来的小逻辑。\n\n{% raw %}\n<center><font size = 9>逆 向 开 方</font></center>\n{% endraw%}\n\n正常情况下，初中生朋友们化简二次根式的方法是酱紫的：将被开方数拆成一个完全平方数乘另一个整数，将拆出来的完全平方数开方后移到根号外面，并且不能使根号下的整数能被再次拆分。\n\n![i2uy2H.png](https://i.imgloc.com/2023/04/01/i2uy2H.png)\n\n这种方法确实可以，在Python里可以枚举出m，再乘2次方，接着用 a/m² 求出n并判断n是否为整数，从而挑出正确答案。\n\n但问题是Python不是准JK，她没法一下知道哪个m最合适，于是就有了这种情况（以对32开方为例）：\n~~~\n>>>  executing file.py\n1√32\n2√8\n4√2\n\n~~~\n没错，前几个答案都是错的，只有最后一个是对的。\n所以我们要**倒着来**！逆向开方时，n从小往大取，那么在所有符合要求的m和n中，第一个冒出来的组合的n值会是所有符合要求的n中最小的。换句话说，第一个算出来的就是**最简二次根式**。\n\n再加上在一些恰到好处的地方加`break`，就能实现算出正确答案后立刻跳出`while`循环。\n\n来都来了，那就把正在施工的开方代码贴出来⑧：\n\n\n\n\n~~~python\nimport math#需要math模块的math.sqrt() 和math.trunk()\nanswerlist = []#记答案用的\n\nclass ExtractionObject:\n    def __init__(self,base) :#就是个正常的类定义\n        self.base = base #base就是要开方的底数\n    \n    def Extraction(self):\n        resultlist = []# 开方的步骤量都会存在这里（第一项是最简二次根式的被开方数，第二项是最简二次根式前面的整数，第三项是任何情况下都会添加的原被开方数\n        key = True\n        while key:\n            test = math.sqrt(self.base)#先开个方试试\n            test_trunked = math.trunc(test)#抹零算法，比以前不用math模块时用的先乘10再除10好多了\n            if test -

color='#C0C0C0'>不久的将来，路网会是这样</font></center>\n但是，这个短短的轻轨网络却有很多有意思的地方，尤其是那个占路网40%长度的2号线——或者**\"延龄草线\"**。延龄草线体现了极致的——省钱——和对于单线铁路和柴油机的极致运用。\n\n![NGxkv.png](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/02/04/NGxkv.png)\n<center><font color='#C0C0C0'>延龄草线的logo，英法双语</font></center>\n什么？你说堂堂世界第二大面积的国家的首都的轨道交通中有一条单线的、短短的、甚至没有电气化的小轻轨？别急嘛……\n<hr>\n\n## 究极省钱的开头\n首先，现在的渥太华卡尔顿交通局（以下简称OC）称路网为\"O-Train\"（以下简称OT），但是在2014年以前那只是这条延龄草线的专有名称，要注意一下。\n\n2001年10月15日，OT正式开始营运。这条短短的单线铁路结束了渥太华长期依赖公交车和Transitway快速公交系统的历史。全线共5车站，其中的卡尔顿站有双向站台以作为待避线，而其他的只有一个侧式站台。够简陋吧？\n![NGXaU.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/02/04/NGXaU.jpeg)<center><font color='#C0C0C0'>真 的 是 单 线 ！</font></center>\n初始的路段可谓是极其省钱。全线的造价**仅为210万加币**，与其他公交项目动辄上亿美元的造价相比确实像是白菜价。而这主要是因为这210万加币仅仅是改造线路的价格。\n\n线路改造自加拿大太平洋铁路公司的渥太华–普雷斯科特铁路的渥太华市区段，施工人员只需再修建几座简洁的车站即可。而且铁路在夜深人静是依然用于货运，可见OT的使用频率也不低。\n\n![NG7B3.png](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/02/04/NG7B3.png)<center><font

color='#C0C0C0'>帅气一点的近照</font></center>\n还有，OC的Talent系列由于数量少，是与德铁一起订购的，涂装都是红白相间的。恰好德铁和OC的主题色都是红和白，OC只用加上OC的标识即可。\n\n所以，当时的线路可不是一般的经济实惠啊233<hr>\n# 走线与车站\n其实OT的走线是比较诡异的，因为整个渥太华市主要是东西方向延伸的，重要的交通压力是东西向的而非南北向。\n![NSaoq.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/02/05/NSaoq.jpeg)<center><font

车辆\nOT以及2014年以后的延龄草线总共运营过三种列车。\n第一代是已经提到的**庞巴迪Talent**。每节Talent由3节车厢组成，首尾的车厢提供动力。运行14年后三列车退役，有多次计划要拍卖这三列Talent,但没有成功。\n![No4tU.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/02/05/No4tU.jpeg)\n第二代是**阿尔斯通**的**Coradia

color='#C0C0C0'>瑞士特产——施泰德的动车组列车</font></center><hr>\n\n## 延伸线与改造\n在原本的OT开通后，渥太华市感受到了轨道交通的力量。于是就有人提出了延伸计划：\n![NvvY8.png](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/02/05/NvvY8.png)\n但是由于具有争议的路线和7亿8千万加元的造价，在2006年此计划被取消。\n\n2011年，也就是1号线联邦线动工后，OC决定将延龄草线向南延伸，并且在2016年的修订版计划中线路会分出一条支线去往渥太华机场。2020年，这条支线又被拆分成了4号线，尽管全程仅3站。2号线和4号线形成了延龄草系统。\n\n除此以外，2号线还将升级车辆，FLIRT的上线会极大提高运行效率，增多的车辆数量也会压缩行车间隔。轨道的复线化与电气化也在计划之内，可见这条本来是试验线的铁路已经获得了关注度。<hr>\n## 有什么能学习的？\n**将重型的国家铁路升级成城市交通的方式**。这点在本系列的第一期[冷门铁路史vol.1|只活了2个月的奥运电车](https://ameitsu.github.io/2023/01/25/%E5%86%B7%E9%97%A8%E9%93%81%E8%B7%AF%E5%8F%B2vol-1/)中就有体现——由废旧铁路升级成的温哥华临时奥运电车。温哥华的奥运电车虽然只运行了2个月，但载客量依然很可观。而渥太华的轻轨作为长期的城市交通系统就更不用提了。\n\n这种模式对一些北美的城市可以说是相当有用了：\n1. 北美（尤其美加）的铁路系统里程长，大部分城市拥有铁路线\n2. 北美在铁路的黄金时期中有大量城际电车产生，并且许多轨道遗留至今\n\n所以完全可以通过改造铁路的方式快速建造城市轨道交通。\n\n但是这种模式的局限性也存在。\n\n首先，铁路的走向不一定与城市交通的需求吻合。延龄草线就因为是南北走向而并非东西走向，对渥太华的拥堵问题没有太多的缓解而受到批评。\n\n其次，如果当时的改造项目成功，后期需要升级改造，造价也是不菲的，甚至和新建线路一样。\n[![NvqGt.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/02/05/NvqGt.jpeg)](https://imgloc.com/i/NvqGt)\n但是这毕竟也是可以尝试的交通方式。哪个城市不想轻轻松松获得一条轨道交通线？\n\n<hr>\n\n#

历史\n芝山铁道本身的历史比旁边的成田机场更和平一些。\n\n1981年5月，芝山铁道成立，并在7年后获得运营资格。当时计划使用小型电车，但应当地人要求改成了普通电车。\n![](https://tse4-mm.cn.bing.net/th/id/OIP-C.h-nDF3mOjZvjfkXehrFqaQHaE9?pid%3DImgDet%26rs%3D1)\n1990年芝山铁道决定与京成电铁直通运营，最终的直通运营在2002年开始。之前的芝山铁道使用的是胎死腹中的成田新干线位于地下的已有设施，直通后与京成共用东成田站\n\n虽然本线里程很短，但是受到了芝山人们的热烈支持，因为它打通了原先被成田机场阻断的直接南北交通线，使乘客能更便利地前往附近的成田市。目前有将线路直接延伸至芝山市中心的计划，但是目前肯定是没有迹象了。\n\n但是吧，为了改善交通那为神魔不直接修到芝山市区呢？还有为什么延长计划就是无法落实呢？来康康冷门铁路史系列的**第一和第二个番外篇**……\n<hr>\n\n# 冷门铁路史番外1|东京最尴尬的机场\n![jIg1C.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/01/28/jIg1C.jpeg)\n芝山铁道旁边成田国际机场可以算得上是东京最尴尬的机场了。\n\n首先，成田国际机场位于远郊区，人烟肯定稀少，但是它比大多数机场的“作息”更“规范”——**每日0时至6时关闭**。\n\n其次，成田国际机场作为东京的主要国际机场、日本的国门之一和一个重要的国际航空枢纽，居然**只有2条跑道**。（伦敦希斯罗也表示很淦）\n\n还有，两条跑道中的**一条仅2500米长**，就比芝山铁道多一些，断绝了这条跑道起降大型客机的可能。\n![jI70P.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/01/28/jI70P.jpeg)\n\n你康康还有哪个重要国际性城市的机场这么寒碜，有这么多限制？（伦敦有六座机场，所以不感觉淦）\n\n（值得一提的是，由于南边羽田机场因气流、跑道重量因素而无法起降A380，因此成田机场1号跑道是东京唯一一座可起降A380的跑道）<hr>\n## 有点暴力的历史\n1962年为了分担羽田机场的客流压力，新东京国际机场提上日程。由于填海造陆技术无法支称在东京湾里修建，规划人员只能从东京郊区着手。最终机场的选址在1966年公布为芝山和三里冢东北侧。\n\n但是当时政府还是采取无偿拆迁的做法，这使当地农民十分不满。再加上那时日本社会运动风起云涌，有人认为这实际是美军在日本新修建的基地，所以附近地区的农民和社会上一些人士成立了“三里冢芝山联合机场反对同盟”，以通过**法律手段、群众示威、甚至暴力行动**来抵制政府新机场修建计划。\n![jIpiH.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/01/28/jIpiH.jpeg)\n<font color='#C0C0C0'><center>太暴力了吧</center></font>\n\n原来预计机场会在1971年完工，但是真到了1971年连机场用地还妹有划出来。后来机场的建设强行开始了，但受到的阻挠也没有减少。1978年3月23日，有激进分子携带燃烧瓶破坏机场设施，因此机场推迟了一年才开放。\n\n1978年5月20日机场正式开放，但机场周围依然被严格把守，无论是否乘坐飞机都必须进行安全检查，直到2015年才取消。\n![jIXzE.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/01/28/jIXzE.jpeg)]\n<font color='#C0C0C0'><center>曾经的防暴车</center></font>\n<hr>\n\n## 所以能看出什么？\n肯定是有偿拆迁对于解决土地资源问题的好处！原住户得到应得的补偿，腾出的土地可以用于建设。\n\n这也造就了中文互联网上各地拆迁暴发户的经典网络梗2333\n<hr>\n\n# 冷门铁路史番外2|全世界最支棱的钉子户\n那么，原来居住在机场用地上的农民朋友最终是以如何的形式妥协的呢？只能是往周边搬迁了。但是，有17户人家选择继续与机场抗争，并且有**8户坚持到了现在**。\n![jIc5F.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/01/28/jIc5F.jpeg)\n<font

总结\n芝山铁道最多只算京成电铁的一条小支线、成田机场的南侧也知名度较低，但从中涉及到的上个世纪成田机场内外的各种矛盾是复杂、无奈甚至有一点悲壮的（以及充满敏感话题）。\n\n而且，下次看到中国部分即将拆除的城中村墙壁上的“拆”字、相关部门用横幅劝居民签合同进行搬迁、而且时常出现的天价拆迁费时，一定要想想在日本千叶发生过的一场持续60多年的因无偿拆迁引发的悲剧……<hr>\n\n#

全长5km的加拿大第三长铁路隧道\n**皇家山隧道**是连接蒙特利尔市区中央车站和和蒙特利尔岛北侧拉瓦尔的铁路线上穿越皇家山的一段隧道、建成于1918年。\n![](https://rem.info/sites/default/files/2018-10/plan%20cite%20modele%20mont%20royal.jpg)\n<center><font

color='#C0C0C0'>麦克唐纳山隧道，也是加拿大太平洋铁路公司运营</font></center>\n\n可以从图中明显看出两条更长的隧道根本**没有电气化**，而皇家山隧道仅长5km就有了接触网，着实有点离谱。但是皇家山隧道和后面两个穿越哥伦比亚山脉的现代隧道还是在时间上有点差距，需要结合当时的情况来看。\n\n20世纪初，电力机车开始投入了更广泛的使用。此前北美大城市普遍出台了**蒸汽机车不能进入市区**的规定，但是当时北美洲铁路电气化才刚刚开始，柴油机车还没出现，所以蒸汽机车才是主流。为了使蒸汽机车开进市区，一些城市修建了短途的横穿城市核心区的隧道（@纽约）。但是由于蒸汽机车会产生大量废气，会阻碍司机视线甚至妨碍呼吸。所以铁路公司想出了权宜之计：用电力机车将蒸汽机车拉进城区，在城区外蒸汽机车才运作。蒙特利尔也属于这种情况，所以短短的5km隧道也被电气化了。电力机车在圣劳伦斯河东岸与列车对接，机车牵引列车通过蒙特利尔地下，从皇家山市方向离开市区。由于整个加拿大铁路在未来几条通勤铁路电气化建成前采取的是柴油化路线，皇家山隧道才因通风原因成了加拿大**唯一一条电气化铁路**。\n\n但是这种临时更换动力方式的做法确实耽误时间，而且需要的设备更多。于是在处于荒郊野岭，交通较少的那两条山区隧道就用了一种简单粗暴的方法解决柴油机车的废气问题：**用风扇抽烟！**（此处挖坑，以后再说233）\n\n## CN时代\n啊，这里的CN可不是中国，也不是氰根，是加拿大加拿大国家铁路公司（Canadian National Railway），简称CN。\n\n![](https://tse2-mm.cn.bing.net/th/id/OIP-C.Y1oZ3kBCN7xCBjZkejwyvQHaE_?pid%3DImgDet%26rs%3D1)\n<center><font

color='#C0C0C0'>经典的红色标志</font></center>\n在1918年，加拿大国家铁路公司成立，整合了一些破产的中小型铁路线，其中就包括皇家山隧道。\n\nCN公司在1930-1960年代间对线路进行了一些开发。最大的建设之一是蒙特利尔中央车站，一座地下车站的建造。1961年CN的总部也迁到了中央车站边的新总部。\n\nCN时代的隧道运营两种电力车辆，一种是 **CN Z-1-a型电力机车**，具有辨识度明显的造型。\n\n![bz2Id.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/01/26/bz2Id.jpeg)\n<center><font

1.改建成地铁，标号为3号线，以红色为标识色。但是为了准备1967年世界博览会，连接会场与市区的4号线优先开工了。然后呢，到了现在3号线也没有出现在蒙特利尔的地铁线路图上，但是再也不可能了。\n\n<font size=1>对于3号线不开这件事，北京市表示很淦</font>\n\n- 2 . 修建一条高速铁路线通往离市区很远的米拉贝尔机场，以类似湾区快速交通一样的区域高速地铁的模式运营。但是这也没有实现，也不可能了，因为米拉贝尔机场改建成货运机场了，连航站楼都在2007年被拆卸。\n\n<hr>\n\n## STCUM、AMT和RTM时代\n以上这三个都是蒙特利尔市的公共交通公司，但并没有同时出现。\n\n1982年，CN将线路运营权移交给了STCUM，CN仍持有线路上的铁路设备。\n\n1992年，魁北克省政府宣布对双山线进行改造，对全线进行电气化。后来线路配置了新的电联车——**庞巴迪MR-90**\n\n![](https://www.cptdb.ca/wiki/images/thumb/4/48/Agence_m%C3%A9tropolitaine_de_transport_432-a.jpg/300px-Agence_m%C3%A9tropolitaine_de_transport_432-a.jpg)\n![label](https://tse4-mm.cn.bing.net/th/id/OIP-C.KmSJbe5ra24H9mO5UVDphAHaGC?pid%3DImgDet%26w%3D1200%26h%3D979%26rs%3D1)\n![Alt

color='#C0C0C0'>你敢信76年以前这辆机车牵引过隧道的首发班次嘛？</font></center>\n\n1996年，线路移交给了AMT。在此之后双山线和皇家山隧道有两次大变动。第一次是AMT在蒙特比勒站东南处修建了一座立交桥，分离了通勤铁路与货运铁路；第二次是2013年马斯库斯线的开通，隧道4米的限高对双层车厢的设计有很大的要求。\n\n2014年，AMT收购了双山线，但为CN预留了使用时段。\n\n2017年，AMT被拆分为RTM和ARTM。RTM接收了原先AMT的铁路线，并将系统更名exo。\n\n<hr>\n\n## 令人感到？？？的REM\n 双山线在2015年就被计划改建成另一个铁路系统**REM**（大都会快速网络）的一部分。\n![bJyNw.jpeg](https://i.328888.xyz/2023/01/26/bJyNw.jpeg)\n从规划图中也能看出REM的一大优势是能整合通勤铁路和地铁线，蒙特利尔的地铁<font color='#FF8C00'>橙</font>线<font color='#4169E1'>蓝</font>线和<font color='\t#2E8B57'>绿</font>线都与REM直接换乘，不像之前通勤铁路只交不换或者换乘需要走很长距离。\n\n REM将使用自动化的轻轨列车，这也使建成后的REM成为世界上第五长的自动铁路系统。\n（REM可讲的太多了，而且也不算太冷门，所以直接从本系列中排除233）\n![](https://uploads.agoramtl.com/optimized/3X/c/a/ca76d4c947616cecb5264bf12b070ab53369325f_2_1760x1172.jpeg)\n\n![](https://uploads.agoramtl.com/original/2X/3/32eaa238a82f45be1cee2e694b27300d8763ccbd.jpeg)\n\n![](https://uploads.agoramtl.com/original/3X/e/1/e1bdd683db406d56b5b2cef3581fd74b6ccd9f16.jpeg)\n\n<center><font

小总结\n从20世纪到21世纪，皇家山隧道见证了铁路的三次大变化：从蒸汽与初步发展的电力技术，到成熟的电气系统，再到先进的自动化。但同时皇家山隧道承载的交通本身也历经了三次大变化：从动辄10多节车厢的国家铁路，到最多10节编组的市郊快线，再到平常2节高峰4节的小轻轨。不得不说，多少有点让人感到矛盾了233\n<hr>\n\n##

*线路*\n线路基本沿着已有的温哥华市区历史铁路改建，中途添加了一处避让轨，同时还升级了首尾两站的站台配置。\n\n![](https://placesjournal.org/assets/legacy/media/images/OlympicLineStreetcar_sm.jpg)\n### *设备*\n但是线路使用的列车不是加拿大本土生产的，而是从比利时**布鲁塞尔**租借的2列庞巴迪Flexicity系列电车。\n\n\n![](https://www.railwaypreservation.com/vintagetrolley/Olympic_Line_12_sm.JPG)\n![](https://www.railwaypreservation.com/vintagetrolley/Olympic_Line_2_sm.jpg)\n![](https://www.railwaypreservation.com/vintagetrolley/Olympic_Line_4_sm.jpg)\n![](https://ts1.cn.mm.bing.net/th/id/R-C.4a428657cb89097fac37458cc0a21b87?rik=L13JKIGAdZG%2f1Q&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.xpats.com%2fsites%2fdefault%2ffiles%2fbrussel_tram_3037.jpg&ehk=onoJ3z8u%2fxONha1ZmvyaSdQB2EF2nbmQvCbDKmrivtU%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)\n<center><font

后续\n2010年1月21日到3月21日，奥林匹克线仅运营了2个月，但是温哥华市政府认为这是一次巨大的成功，两个月内共运送乘客**55万**人次。\n\n庞巴迪因此线13000次运行无任何故障而被CUTA颁发“卓越表现和杰出成就”奖。\n\n奥运会结束后有更多提案建议恢复运营并延长线路至市中心，但是很明显都没有被实施。这主要是因为温哥华市政府太缺钱……\n\n什么？你说最开始的电车线为什么就没了呢?因为接触网改造太困难，就这么**烂尾了**……\n\n<hr>\n\n##

前言\n在2023年1月1日在地铁1号线上我瞅了一眼1号线的线路图然后才发现北京地铁什么时候有了个11号线（请分析出作者连着使用6个数字1的好处-6分）。额，这条线着实有点鸡肋，因为它全程4站，有一站还因北京地铁的传统艺能暂缓开通……但是它的终点站不一般哈，是传说中的2022年冬奥北京城区明星建筑**大跳台**。我寻思在整个2022年里我在**除了历史以外的科目里**都见过考这个地方的题，还没有来过捏，不如来实地考察一下？?\n<hr>\n\n##
